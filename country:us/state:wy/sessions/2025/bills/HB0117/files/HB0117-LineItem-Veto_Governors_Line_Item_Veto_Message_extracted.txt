Omnibus water bill-construction
Dear Speaker Neiman,
Wyoming's Omnibus Water Construction and Planning bills remain a consistent
example of how our state responsibly utilizes our resources to invest in our vital
water infrastructure. These bills are the culmination of countless hours of work by
the Wyoming Water Development Commission, the W,aterDevelopment Office,
the Legislature's Select Water Committee, irrigation districts, and project sponsors
statewide. This year, these bills found themselves under the spotlight again with
the recent LaPrele Dam breach order.
Despite the extraordinarily acrobatic approach this Legislature took regarding
spending priorities, I thank legislators for heeding my call and working
cooperatively to address the Laprele Dam situation and Wyoming's ability to
effectively engage with interstate water negotiations. Mother Nature and
downstream states will not wait around for Wyoming to act.
I understand the Legislature's desire to pursue additional public benefits for the
amount of funding going towards the LaPrele Dam pro5ect .However, existing
authorities already allow the Office of State Lands and Investments (OSLI) to
investigate such benefits without the need for Section 7 of the Omnibus water bill-
construction. To advance the Legislature's goal and avoid a separation of powers
issue, as Chairman of the State Board of Land Commissioners, I will request that
OSLI perform an analysis of opportunities to expand public access and recreational
