2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0246
1 This amendment would expressly provide that the power of
2 taxation and spending belongs only to the legislative and
3 executive branches of state government. The amendment would
4 allow the legislature to delegate taxation and spending
5 authority to political subdivisions and would allow the
6 legislature to delegate ministerial tasks to the executive
7 branch, with the judicial branch authorized to enforce the
8 performance of those delegated duties. For funding
9 operational costs of public schools, the legislature would be
10 required to develop a funding formula, which would be subject
11 to judicial review. The amount of any appropriation based on
12 the formula would not be subject to judicial review. If the
13 legislature's appropriation is insufficient to fund the
14 spending provided by the formula, then expenditures for
15 school funding would be reduced uniformly.
