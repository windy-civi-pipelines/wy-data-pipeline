WHEREAS, the common school account within the permanent land
fund has grown over the years and has been invested to where
the current value of the fund exceeds five billion six hundred
million dollars ($5,600,000,000.00); and
WHEREAS, the investment of the funds in the common school
account generates earnings and capital gains that are in
addition to interest and income generated from the funds; and
WHEREAS, an amendment to Wyoming's Act of Admission that would
replace references to "interest" and "income" with references
to "earnings" will better reflect the reality of how the
common school account is invested and will allow the earnings
that are generated from the investment of the permanent funds
of the common school account to be better and more efficiently
applied for the benefit of Wyoming's public schools.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING:
