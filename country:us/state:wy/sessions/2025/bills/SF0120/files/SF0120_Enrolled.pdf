2025 GENERAL SESSION
(iv) The producer shall not publish any
statement associated with the meat that implies or states
the Wyoming department of agriculture's approval or
endorsement of meat delivered under this subsection.
(o) Subsection (n) of this section shall be effective
on the date that the governor, on advice of the attorney
general, certifies to the secretary of state that the sale
of meat products from cattle, sheep, swine or goats raised
by the producer that were slaughtered on the premises of
the producer or at a custom slaughter facility is legalized
under federal law. Legalization under federal law shall
constitute either the passage of a federal law that allows
direct-to-consumer sales of uninspected meat products or
the issuance of a final decision by a federal court with
jurisdiction over this state that declares that the federal
prohibition on direct-to-consumer sales is unconstitutional
or otherwise invalid. Sales of meat products under
subsection (n) of this section shall be allowed upon the
governor's certification to the secretary of state that
sales of uninspected meat products have been legalized
under federal law.
Section 2.
(a) Upon certification by the governor that W.S.
11-49-103(n), as created by section 1 of this act, is
effective:
(i) The department of agriculture may promulgate
any rules necessary to implement this act;
