13 District of Columbia or the federal district where the
14 commission has its principal offices against a member state
15 in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the

5 2. Enhance the states' ability to protect the
6 public's health and safety;

10
11 4. Support spouses of relocating military members;
12
13 5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative
14 and disciplinary information between member states; and
15
16 6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of
