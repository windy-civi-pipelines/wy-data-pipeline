7 of this section for a cow or calf moose or a ewe or lamb
8 bighorn sheep license, shall be eligible to apply for or

13 ewe or lamb bighorn sheep or cow or calf moose. The
14 commission may issue hunting licenses to any person to

17
18 (g) In addition to the authority granted under

20 rule and regulation develop and implement a preference
21 point program for nonresident antelope, nonresident deer

6 SF0002

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0058
1 program established pursuant to this subsection may be
2 implemented for all or selected hunt areas and may be
3 applied to all or portions of licenses for any particular
4 species antelope, deer and elk. The commission may charge
5 nonresident license applicants a nonrefundable fee to
6 accumulate preference points under the program as provided
7 in W.S. 23-2-101(m).
8
9 (h) Rules and regulations shall be promulgated by the
10 game and fish commission to carry out subsections (a)
11 through (f) and (j) of this section and may be promulgated
12 as provided in subsection (g) of this section.
13
14 (j) Licenses issued under this subsection for
15 antlered moose and ram bighorn sheep shall be issued
16 partially through a weighted bonus point random drawing and
17 partially through a random drawing of all remaining
18 unsuccessful applicants for that year. The department shall
19 assign bonus points to each applicant for an antlered moose
20 or ram bighorn sheep license by multiplying the number of
21 years the applicant has unsuccessfully applied for an
22 antlered moose or ram bighorn sheep license times one (1).
23 The department shall then square an applicant's assigned
7 SF0002

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0058
1 bonus points to determine the applicant's total entry for
2 the weighted bonus point random drawing. An applicant's
3 total number of weighted bonus points shall not accumulate
4 year to year and shall be recalculated each year based on
5 the applicant's assigned bonus points. The calculation used
6 to assign bonus points to an applicant for an antlered
7 moose or ram bighorn sheep under this subsection shall
8 include any year the applicant does not apply for an
9 antlered moose or ram bighorn sheep license, provided in
10 the case of a resident the applicant pays the fee specified
11 in W.S. 23-2-101(k), and in the case of a nonresident, the
12 applicant pays the appropriate fee established by the
13 commission under W.S. 23-2-101(m). For purposes of
14 assigning bonus points under this subsection, any
15 unsuccessful applicant failing to apply for a license, or
16 pay the applicable fee in lieu of applying, during the
17 second calendar year shall be considered to be a first year
18 applicant for any subsequent calendar year in which the
19 applicant submits a license application for an antlered
20 moose or ram bighorn sheep. Not less than fifty percent
21 (50%) of available licenses issued under this subsection
22 for an antlered moose or ram bighorn sheep within any hunt
23 area shall be randomly selected through a weighted bonus
8 SF0002

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0058
1 point drawing where each applicant has a number of entries
2 equal to the applicant's number of weighted bonus points
3 until all applicants have been exhausted or until all
4 available licenses have been issued, whichever first
5 occurs. After the selections through the weighted bonus
6 point drawing have been completed within a hunt area, the
7 remaining licenses available from that drawing and the
8 licenses available for the random drawing for that hunt
9 area will be issued through a random selection from among
10 all applicants in the hunt area who were not selected for
11 issuance of a license for an antlered moose or ram bighorn
12 sheep through the weighted bonus point drawing in that hunt
13 area.
14
15 23-1-705. Complimentary licenses; pioneer licenses;

19 (a) At the request of the governor, the commission
20 shall annually issue up to twenty-five (25) complimentary
21 hunting and twenty-five (25) complimentary fishing

23 moose and five (5) wild bison licenses shall be issued
9 SF0002

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0058
1 under this subsection. The five (5) year restriction
2 imposed on the receipt of a cow or calf moose, or ewe or
3 lamb bighorn sheep or wild bison license by W.S.
4 23-1-703(b) and (c) 23-1-703(c), and any restriction
5 imposed on taking of wild bison under commission rule and
6 regulation shall not be applicable in any manner to a
7 license issued pursuant to this subsection. Except as
8 provided under subsection (g) of this section, no
9 complimentary licenses may be issued at the request of the
10 appointed commissioners. Immediately upon issuance of any
11 of these licenses, the commission shall submit to the
12 secretary of state for maintenance as a public record, the
13 name and address of each licensee and the type of license
14 issued.
15
16 (k) The holder of any valid big game animal license,
17 trophy game animal license, any wild bison license or a
18 female or calf wild bison license may surrender said
19 license to the department for reissuance to a veteran with
20 disabilities or a person with a permanent disability who
21 uses a wheelchair as established by commission rule and
22 regulation selected and sponsored by a nonprofit charitable
23 organization providing hunting opportunities to a veteran
10 SF0002

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0058
1 with disabilities or a person with a permanent disability
2 who uses a wheelchair. Any license reissued in accordance
3 with the provisions of this subsection shall be for the
4 same species, area and license type as the license donated.
5 The license shall be reissued by the department to a
6 qualifying person at no fee. Any license donated and
7 reissued under the provisions of this subsection shall not
8 be sold, traded, auctioned or offered for any monetary
9 value and shall not be issued to, or used by, any person
10 other than a qualifying person under the provision of this
11 section and in compliance with commission rule and
12 regulation. Licenses reissued to persons pursuant to this
13 subsection shall not be subject to residency, drawing or
14 fee requirements under W.S. 23-2-101 or 23-2-107. The five
15 (5) year restriction imposed on the receipt of a cow or
16 calf moose or a ewe or lamb bighorn sheep license by W.S.
17 23-1-703(b), and the lifetime restriction imposed on the
18 receipt of a grizzly bear, mountain goat, ram or any
19 bighorn sheep, any wild bison or any moose or antlered
20 moose license by W.S. 23-1-703(c) or the restrictions
21 imposed on a wild bison under W.S. 23-2-107(f) shall not be
22 applicable in any manner to a license issued pursuant to
23 this subsection.

5
6 (g) In promulgating rules and regulations for the
7 taking of bighorn sheep and moose, the commission shall not
8 discriminate between residents and nonresidents regarding
9 the maturity and horn size of the animals which may be
10 taken. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as
11 prohibiting the commission from issuing a different number
12 of licenses for residents and nonresidents, from requiring
13 a bonus point or preference point fee from nonresidents
14 only pursuant to subsection (m) of this section or from
15 issuing reduced price ewe and lamb bighorn sheep licenses
16 as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
17
18 (k) Any resident qualified to purchase a moose or ram
19 bighorn sheep hunting license under subsection (j) of this
20 section may pay a fee of seven dollars ($7.00) in lieu of
21 applying for a moose or ram bighorn sheep hunting license.
22 Payment of the fee for a particular species under this

4 applied for a hunting license for that species. Payment of
5 the fee shall be made in compliance with application dates.
6
7 (m) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, as
8 part of any bonus point program for nonresident ram bighorn
9 sheep or nonresident antlered moose and any preference
10 point program for nonresident antelope, nonresident ram
11 bighorn sheep, nonresident moose, nonresident deer or
12 nonresident elk, the commission may establish a
13 nonrefundable fee to be either withheld from the license
14 fee remitted or submitted separately when application for a
15 license, bonus point or preference point is made through
16 electronic licensing, and may also establish a fee to be
17 paid in lieu of applying for licenses that are limited in
18 quota. Retention of the established fee or payment of the
19 fee in lieu of applying shall authorize the person to
20 accumulate be assigned a bonus point or to accumulate a
21 preference point for future drawings for licenses that are
