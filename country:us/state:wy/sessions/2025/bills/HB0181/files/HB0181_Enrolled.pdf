4-10-901 and 4-10-902, is an approved investment. Earnings,
including interest, income and dividends, from any
investment of an irrevocable pre-need funeral trust may
inure to the benefit of the seller of the prepaid or
prearranged funeral contract, but shall be withdrawn from
the irrevocable trust only upon the occurrence of an event
that requires withdrawal of the corpus of the trust.
Neither the person purchasing a prepaid or prearranged
funeral contract nor any person for whom the contract is
purchased shall be entitled to terminate or cancel the
contract or make demand for the funds paid for the contract
after the funds are deposited into an irrevocable pre-need
funeral trust.
(b) The commissioner shall promulgate rules and
regulations for the purposes specified in subsection (a) of
this section to include regulation of contract provisions
and funds thereunder. The rules shall require notice to
buyers of prepaid or prearranged funeral contracts of the
types of investments into which funds derived from the sale
of these contracts may be deposited and the risks
associated with those investments. The rules shall require
notice to buyers of the ability to cancel or terminate a
contract or make demand for any amounts paid for the
contract. Rules promulgated by the commissioner shall not
require any additional surety bond amount for those monies
deposited in an irrevocable pre-need funeral trust and
invested in compliance with W.S 4-10-902 beyond the minimum
surety bond required of all persons deriving funds from
prepaid or prearranged funeral contracts.
