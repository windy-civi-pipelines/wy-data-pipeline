18 state depository is subject to any public enforcement
19 action by any federal or state regulatory entity, the state
20 depository shall notify the secretary of the board of the

4 invest and in an amount equal, at least, to the maximum
5 amount of money at any time to be deposited with the bank

14 one-half to one (1.5:1) of the value of public funds
15 secured by them. A pledge of collateral as security for
16 the deposit of public funds shall be accompanied by a
17 written assignment from the depository vesting legal title
18 thereto to the state and by any other instruments required
19 by the state treasurer. The assignment shall provide that
20 the depository shall pay over deposited public funds and
21 accrued interest thereon to the state treasurer, or his
22 authorized deputy, upon check, order or demand in
23 accordance with this article. The assignment shall also

2 defaults, to sell all collateral necessary to realize the
3 full amount of deposited public funds and interest accrued
4 thereon. The interest on bonds, debentures and other

13 and the acts of congress relating thereto, shall give and
14 at all times maintain security for the prompt payment and
15 the safekeeping of the whole amount of any such deposit.
16 The deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit
17 Insurance Corporation or the national credit union share
18 insurance fund, if applicable, is eligible as the security
19 required for the portion of any deposit that is insured by
20 the corporation, and constitutes all of the security
21 required for the portion. Any portion of the deposit as is
