13 SF0127

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0526
1 filed with the registrar of rules and made available for

15 statements of general policy, the agency shall:
16
17 (i) Give at least forty-five (45) days notice of
18 its intended action. Notice shall be mailed to all persons
19 making timely requests of the agency for advanced notice of
20 its rulemaking proceedings and to the attorney general, the
21 secretary of state's office as registrar of rules, and the

14 SF0127

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0526

2 local agency may proceed with the emergency rule when
3 notice of the emergency is filed with the local registrar
4 of rules.
5
6 (c) No rule is valid unless submitted, filed and
7 adopted in substantial compliance with this section and, if
8 the rule is or could be a major agency rule, W.S.
9 16-3-103.1. A proceeding to contest any rule on the ground
10 of noncompliance with the procedural requirements of this
11 section must or the requirements of W.S. 16-3-103.1 shall
12 be commenced within two (2) years from the effective date
13 of the rule.
14
15 (d) No state agency rule or any amendment, repeal,
16 modification or revision of the rule may be filed with the
17 registrar of rules unless the rule has been submitted to
18 the governor for review and the governor has approved and
19 signed the rule. Except in the case of emergency rules and
20 rules adopted by the game and fish commission fixing
21 general hunting or fishing regulations, season or bag
22 limits or establishing hunting areas, the governor shall

5 approving rules, the governor may disapprove any portion of
6 a rule not conforming to paragraphs (d)(i), (ii) or (iii)
7 of this section by clearly indicating the portion of the
8 rule disapproved and the basis for the disapproval. Major
9 agency rules approved by the governor under this subsection
10 shall be subject to ratification under W.S. 16-3-103.1.
11 Only those portions of a rule approved by the governor
12 shall be filed with the registrar of rules as provided by
13 W.S. 16-3-104(a). Any portion of a rule disapproved by the
14 governor shall be returned to the agency and shall be null
15 and void and shall not be filed, implemented or enforced.
16 The governor shall report his disapproval of any rule or
17 portion thereof to the management council within fifteen
18 (15) days. The governor shall not approve any rule or any
19 amendment, repeal, modification or revision of the rule
20 unless it:

3 and assistance of attorney general.
