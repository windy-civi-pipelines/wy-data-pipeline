10
11 (i) An application to the Congress of the United
12 States to call a convention of the several states pursuant to
13 Article V of the United States Constitution for the purpose
14 of proposing amendments to the Constitution confers no power
15 to Congress other than the power to call the convention. The
16 power of Congress to exercise this ministerial duty consists
17 solely of the authority to name a reasonable time and place
18 for the initial meeting of a convention;
19
20 (ii) Congress shall call an amendment convention
21 of the states only upon the receipt of applications for an

11 remains exclusively within the authority of the legislatures
12 of the several states;
13
14 (iv) By definition, a convention of the states to

17 vote;
18
19 (v) A convention of the several states to propose
