3 "(C) The county treasurer for each county shall
4 keep accurate records of the reduction in tax revenues caused by
5 the homeowner tax exemption provided by this paragraph for the
6 county and for each governmental entity for which notification is
7 made pursuant to W.S. 39-13-104(k) and shall report that
8 information to the department. The department shall compile and
9 verify the information received from each county and shall verify
10 any reductions in the distribution of mill levies to the school
11 foundation program account under W.S. 21-13-303. Subject to
12 appropriation of funds by the legislature, the department shall
13 distribute verified amounts to each county treasurer for
14 distribution as provided in W.S. 39-13-111 in an amount necessary
15 to compensate each government entity for fifty percent (50%) of
16 the reduction in tax revenues due to the exemption under this
17 paragraph. If funds appropriated by the legislature for
18 distribution under this subparagraph are insufficient to complete
19 all necessary distributions, there is appropriated to the
20 department of revenue from the legislative stabilization reserve
21 account an amount equal to the amount by which legislative
22 appropriations are insufficient to make distributions necessary
23 under this subparagraph for the current tax year. The department
24 shall transfer this legislative stabilization reserve account
25 appropriation to each county for distribution to each government
26 entity in an amount necessary to compensate each government entity
27 for fifty percent (50%) of the reduction in tax revenues. No
28 appropriation from the legislative stabilization reserve account
29 shall be authorized under this paragraph after June 30, 2027 and
30 total appropriations from the legislative stabilization reserve
31 account under this subparagraph shall not exceed one hundred
32 million dollars ($100,000,000.00). If funds appropriated by the
33 legislature for distribution under this subparagraph are
34 insufficient to complete all necessary distributions, the
35 department shall distribute funds to each government entity on a
36 pro rata basis;".
