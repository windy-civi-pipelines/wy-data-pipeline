17 permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund reserve account, but prior to
18 calculating the balance of the account under this subsection, the
19 state treasurer shall transfer from the account an amount equal to
20 the difference between the maximum amount which may be credited to
21 the legislative stabilization reserve account pursuant to
22 subsection (q) of this section and the amount actually credited to

30 county and for each governmental entity for which notification is
31 made pursuant to W.S. 39-13-104(k) and shall report that
32 information to the department. The department shall compile and
33 verify the information received from each county and shall verify
34 any reductions in the distribution of mill levies to the school
35 foundation program account under W.S. 21-13-303. Subject to
36 appropriation of funds by the legislature, the department shall
37 distribute verified amounts to each county treasurer for
38 distribution as provided in W.S. 39-13-111 in an amount necessary
39 to compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
40 revenues due to the exemption under this paragraph. If funds
41 appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
42 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
43 distributions, there is appropriated to the department of revenue
44 from the legislative stabilization reserve account an amount equal
45 to the amount by which legislative appropriations are insufficient
46 to make distributions necessary under this subparagraph for the
47 current tax year. The department shall transfer this legislative
2
1 stabilization reserve account appropriation to each county for
2 distribution to each government entity in an amount necessary to
3 compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
4 revenues. No appropriation from the legislative stabilization
5 reserve account shall be authorized under this paragraph after
6 June 30, 2027 and total appropriations from the legislative
7 stabilization reserve account under this subparagraph shall not
8 exceed two hundred twenty million dollars ($220,000,000.00).If
9 funds appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
10 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
11 distributions, the department shall distribute funds to each
12 government entity on a pro rata basis.". HARSHMAN
