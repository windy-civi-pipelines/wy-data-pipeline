18 reserve account. If the reconciliation reveals a shortfall in
19 payments to the general fund, the treasurer shall pay the shortfall
20 amount from the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund reserve
21 account to the general fund;.
22
23 (iii) As soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal
24 year, after making any other transfers provided by law from the
25 permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund reserve account, but prior to
26 calculating the balance of the account under this subsection, the
27 state treasurer shall transfer from the account an amount equal to
28 the difference between the maximum amount which may be credited to
29 the legislative stabilization reserve account pursuant to

7 to compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
8 revenues due to the exemption under this paragraph. If funds
9 appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
10 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
11 distributions, there is appropriated to the department of revenue
12 from the legislative stabilization reserve account an amount equal
13 to the amount by which legislative appropriations are insufficient
14 to make distributions necessary under this subparagraph for the
15 current tax year. The department shall transfer this legislative
16 stabilization reserve account appropriation to each county for
17 distribution to each government entity in an amount necessary to
18 compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
19 revenues. No appropriation from the legislative stabilization
20 reserve account shall be authorized under this paragraph after
21 June 30, 2027 and total appropriations from the legislative
22 stabilization reserve account under this subparagraph shall not
23 exceed two hundred twenty million dollars ($220,000,000.00).If
