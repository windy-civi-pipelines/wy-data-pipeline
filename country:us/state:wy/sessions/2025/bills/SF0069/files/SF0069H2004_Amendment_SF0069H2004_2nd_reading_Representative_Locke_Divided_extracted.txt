8 the homeowner tax exemption provided by this paragraph for the
9 county and for each governmental entity for which notification is
10 made pursuant to W.S. 39-13-104(k) and shall report that
11 information to the department. The department shall compile and
12 verify the information received from each county and shall verify
13 any reductions in the distribution of mill levies to the school
14 foundation program account under W.S. 21-13-303. Subject to
15 appropriation of funds by the legislature, the department shall
16 distribute verified amounts to each county treasurer for
17 distribution as provided in W.S. 39-13-111 in an amount necessary
18 to compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
19 revenues due to the exemption under this paragraph. If funds
20 appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
21 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
22 distributions, there is appropriated to the department of revenue
23 from the legislative stabilization reserve account an amount equal
24 to the amount by which legislative appropriations are insufficient
25 to make distributions necessary under this subparagraph for the
26 current tax year. The department shall transfer this legislative
27 stabilization reserve account appropriation to each county for
28 distribution to each government entity in an amount necessary to
29 compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
30 revenues. No appropriation from the legislative stabilization
31 reserve account shall be authorized under this paragraph after
32 June 30, 2027 and total appropriations from the legislative
33 stabilization reserve account under this subparagraph shall not
34 exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00). If funds
35 appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
36 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
37 distributions, the department shall distribute funds to each
