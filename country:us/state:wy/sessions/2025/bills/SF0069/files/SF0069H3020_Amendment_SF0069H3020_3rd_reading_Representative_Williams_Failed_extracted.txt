37 from the appropriation in subsection (a) of this section shall be
38 available for distribution for purposes of restoring revenue
39 attributable to any reduction in residential property tax
40 assessments from tax year 2026.
41

21 and any special district located outside of a county qualified
22 under subsection (c) of this section shall prepare a grant
23 application to the department of revenue on behalf of the county
24 and all cities, towns and qualifying special districts in the
25 county. If awarded grant funds under this section, the county shall
26 distribute the funds in proportion to the demonstrated reduction
27 in residential property tax assessments as compared to tax year
28 2024 and directly attributable to legislation exempting or
29 otherwise reducing residential property tax assessments enacted
30 during the 2025 general session.
31
32 (e) Grants awarded under this section shall not exceed an
33 amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the demonstrated
34 reduction of residential property tax assessments as compared to

40 residential property tax assessments under this section, the
41 department of revenue shall make the grant awards on a pro rata
42 basis.
