20 "(C) The county treasurer for each county shall
21 keep accurate records of the reduction in tax revenues caused by
22 the homeowner tax exemption provided by this paragraph for the
23 county and for each governmental entity for which notification is
24 made pursuant to W.S. 39-13-104(k) and shall report that
25 information to the department. The department shall compile and
26 verify the information received from each county and shall verify
27 any reductions in the distribution of mill levies to the school
28 foundation program account under W.S. 21-13-303. Subject to
29 appropriation of funds by the legislature, the department shall
30 distribute verified amounts to each county treasurer for
31 distribution as provided in W.S. 39-13-111 in an amount necessary
32 to compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
33 revenues due to the exemption under this paragraph. If funds
34 appropriated by the legislature for distribution under this
35 subparagraph are insufficient to complete all necessary
36 distributions, there is appropriated to the department of revenue
37 from the legislative stabilization reserve account an amount equal
38 to the amount by which legislative appropriations are insufficient
39 to make distributions necessary under this subparagraph for the
40 current tax year. The department shall transfer this legislative
41 stabilization reserve account appropriation to each county for
42 distribution to each government entity in an amount necessary to
43 compensate each government entity for the reduction in tax
44 revenues. The department shall not distribute more than fifty
1

1 percent (50%) of the funds available in tax year 2025 and shall
2 distribute the remainder of any funds available in tax year 2026.
3 No appropriation from the legislative stabilization reserve
4 account shall be authorized under this paragraph after June 30,
5 2027 and total appropriations from the legislative stabilization
6 reserve account under this subparagraph shall not exceed one
7 hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00). If funds appropriated
8 by the legislature for distribution under this subparagraph are
9 insufficient to complete all necessary distributions, the
10 department shall distribute funds to each government entity on a
11 pro rata basis;".
