7

1 commission may use funds available in accordance with
2 paragraph (vi) of this subsection.
3
4 (v) The commission may impose an assessment on
5 each participating operator on the fair cash market value,
6 as provided in W.S. 39-14-203, of all oil and gas produced,
7 sold or transported from the operator's wells in Wyoming
8 that are covered under this subsection in accordance with
9 this paragraph. Beginning on July 1, 2025 through June 30,
10 2030, the assessment shall be zero (0) mills on the dollar.
11 Beginning July 1, 2030, the commission may impose an
12 assessment under this paragraph in an amount not to exceed
13 five-tenths of one (1) mill ($0.0005) on the dollar. All
14 funds collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in
15 the separate account established under W.S. 30-5-116(b).
16 For purposes of accounting and investing, funds collected
17 under this paragraph shall be accounted for separately.
18 Funds collected under this paragraph shall be expended only
19 on the bonding pool established under paragraph (iii) or
20 (iv) of this subsection;
21
22 (vi) If funds collected under paragraph (v) of
23 this subsection are insufficient to satisfy the obligations
5 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 of the bonding pool established under paragraph (iii) or
2 (iv) of this subsection, the commission may expend any
3 unexpended and unobligated funds available in the account

5
6 (vii) Funds expended under this subsection shall
7 only be expended on expenses associated with the plugging

12 under this subsection;
13
14 (viii) The commission may enter into agreements

19 participating in the bonding pool established in this
20 subsection whose wells are located on federal land, without

22
6 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 (ix) The commission may provide for the transfer
2 of an operator's financial assurance provided under this
3 section to another operator, if the transfer is necessary

5 the bonding options established under this section. No
6 transfer shall occur until the commission has completed a
7 bonding review of the operator to whom the financial
8 assurance is transferred;
9
10 (x) The commission may establish a process by
11 which an operator in good standing with the commission and
12 that participates in the bonding pool established under
13 this subsection may reduce requirements associated with the
14 furnishing of a surety bond or other guaranty in accordance
15 with this act. Nothing under this paragraph shall be
16 construed to relieve an operator of the requirement to pay
17 any assessment imposed under paragraph (v) of this
18 subsection. Before the commission reduces bonding
19 requirements under this paragraph, the commission shall
20 complete a risk analysis to ensure that the reduction does
21 not:
22
7 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 (A) Increase the risk that an operator will
2 be unable to satisfy all plugging and repairing
3 requirements for the operator's wells; and
4

11 (xi) Not later than October 1, 2025 and each
12 October 1 thereafter, the commission shall report to the
13 joint minerals, business and economic development interim
14 committee and the joint appropriations committee on the

13 any expenses for the plugging of dry or abandoned wells,
14 for reclamation requirements, for the forfeiture of any
15 applicable bond and for any other requirements associated
16 with the operator's applicable bonds for operators
17 participating under this section. In establishing the

14

6 Section 2. W.S. 30-5-116(b)(intro), 30-5-404(g) and

8
9 30-5-116. Disposition of monies; permissible
10 expenditures; payment of expenses; charge assessed on value
11 of oil or gas produced.
12
13 (b) There is assessed on the fair cash market value
14 as provided by W.S. 39-14-203, of all oil and gas produced,
15 sold or transported from the premises in Wyoming a charge
16 not to exceed eight-tenths of one (1) mill ($.0008) on the
17 dollar. The commission shall by order fix the amount of the
18 charge in the first instance and may reduce or increase the
19 amount as the expenses chargeable may require. The amounts
20 fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit
21 prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to
22 collect all assessments. All monies collected shall be
23 remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate
13 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses
2 incurred in connection with the administration and
3 enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119 and to pay
4 the expenses for the plugging of dry or abandoned wells,
5 for reclamation requirements, for the forfeiture of any
6 applicable bond and for any other requirements associated

13 proportion to their ownership at the time of production.
14 The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is
15 payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of
16 the second month following the month in which the charge
17 accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other
18 interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within
19 this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any
20 charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at
21 the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of
22 delinquency until paid. This charge together with the
23 interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is
14 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 levied and assessed. The person paying the charge as
2 provided is authorized and required to deduct from any
3 amounts due the persons owning an interest in the oil and
4 gas or in the proceeds at the time of production the
5 proportionate amount of the charge before making the
6 payment. Subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all
7 lands in the state of Wyoming, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of W.S. 30-5-118, however, there is exempted
9 from the charge as levied and assessed the following:
10
11 30-5-404. Surety bond or guaranty; approval;
12 objections; release of surety bond or guaranty.
13
14 (g) Any surety bond or guaranty executed under this
15 section shall be in addition to the surety bond or guaranty
16 required under W.S. 30-5-104(d)(i)(D) and 30-5-129 for
17 reclamation and compliance with rules and orders of the
18 commission.
19
20 35-11-504. Bonding for solid waste management
21 facilities.

15 SF0020
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092

8
9 30-5-116. Disposition of monies; permissible

15 sold or transported from the premises in Wyoming a charge
16 not to exceed eight-tenths of one (1) mill ($.0008) on the

19 amount as the expenses chargeable may require. The amounts
20 fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit
21 prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to

23 remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate
13 SF0020

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses
2 incurred in connection with the administration and
3 enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119 and to pay
4 the expenses for the plugging of dry or abandoned wells,
5 for reclamation requirements, for the forfeiture of any
6 applicable bond and for any other requirements associated

14 The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is
15 payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of
16 the second month following the month in which the charge
17 accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other
18 interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within
19 this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any
20 charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at
21 the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of
22 delinquency until paid. This charge together with the
23 interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is
14 SF0020

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0092
1 levied and assessed. The person paying the charge as
2 provided is authorized and required to deduct from any
3 amounts due the persons owning an interest in the oil and
4 gas or in the proceeds at the time of production the
5 proportionate amount of the charge before making the
6 payment. Subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all
7 lands in the state of Wyoming, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of W.S. 30-5-118, however, there is exempted
9 from the charge as levied and assessed the following:
10
11 30-5-404. Surety bond or guaranty; approval;
12 objections; release of surety bond or guaranty.
13
14 (g) Any surety bond or guaranty executed under this

17 reclamation and compliance with rules and orders of the
18 commission.
