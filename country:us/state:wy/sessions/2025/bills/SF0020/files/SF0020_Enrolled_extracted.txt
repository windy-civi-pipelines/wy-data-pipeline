fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit
prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to
collect all assessments. All monies collected shall be
remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate
account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the administration and
enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119 and to pay
the expenses for the plugging of dry or abandoned wells,
for reclamation requirements, for the forfeiture of any

The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is
payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of
the second month following the month in which the charge
accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other
interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within
this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any
charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at
the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of
delinquency until paid. This charge together with the
interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is
levied and assessed. The person paying the charge as

(b) There is assessed on the fair cash market value
as provided by W.S. 39-14-203, of all oil and gas produced,
sold or transported from the premises in Wyoming a charge
not to exceed eight-tenths of one (1) mill ($.0008) on the
dollar. The commission shall by order fix the amount of the
charge in the first instance and may reduce or increase the
amount as the expenses chargeable may require. The amounts
fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit
prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to
collect all assessments. All monies collected shall be
remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate
account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the administration and
enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119 and to pay
the expenses for the plugging of dry or abandoned wells,
for reclamation requirements, for the forfeiture of any
applicable bond and for any other requirements associated
with the operator's applicable bonds for operators
participating in the program established under W.S.
30-5-129. The persons owning a working interest, royalty
interest, payments out of production, or any other interest
in the oil and gas or in the proceeds thereof, subject to
the charge in this subsection are liable for the charge in
proportion to their ownership at the time of production.
The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is
payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of
the second month following the month in which the charge
accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other
interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within
this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any
charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at
the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of
delinquency until paid. This charge together with the
interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is
levied and assessed. The person paying the charge as
