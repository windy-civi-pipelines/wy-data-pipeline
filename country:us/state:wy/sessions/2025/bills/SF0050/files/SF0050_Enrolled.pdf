26-44-104. Registration of insurers; group capital
calculations; liquidity stress test results.
(e) Information need not be disclosed on the
registration statement filed pursuant to subsection (b) of
this section if the information is not material for the
purposes of this section. Unless the commissioner by rule,
regulation or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases,
exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments or
guarantees involving one-half of one percent (.5%) or less
of an insurer's admitted assets as of December 31, of the
year immediately preceding are not material for purposes of
this section. As used in this subsection, "material" shall
not apply for purposes of the group capital calculation or

(p) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
registration under this section shall concurrently file

including the group capital ratio produced within the

The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC
group capital calculation instructions, which may permit
the lead state commissioner to allow a controlling person
that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the
group capital calculation. The report shall be filed with
the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding
company system as determined by the commissioner in
accordance with the procedures within the financial
analysis handbook adopted by the NAIC. The following shall
apply to this subsection:

ENROLLED ACT NO. 64, SENATE
SIXTY-EIGHTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING
2025 GENERAL SESSION
(i) The following insurance holding company
systems are exempt from filing the group capital
calculation:
(A) An insurance holding company system
that has only one (1) insurer within its holding company
structure, that only writes business and is only licensed
in its domestic state, and that assumes no business from
any other insurer;
(B) An insurance holding company system
that is required to perform a group capital calculation
specified by the United States federal reserve board. The
lead state commissioner shall request the calculation from
the United States federal reserve board under the terms of
information sharing agreements in effect. If the United
States federal reserve board cannot share the calculation
with the lead state commissioner, the insurance holding
company system is not exempt from the group capital
calculation filing;
(C) An insurance holding company system
whose non-United States group wide supervisor is located
within a reciprocal jurisdiction as described in W.S.
26-5-112(j)(ii) that recognizes the United States state
regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital;
(D) An insurance holding company system:
(I) That provides information to the
lead state that meets the requirements for accreditation
under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation
program, either directly or indirectly through the group
wide supervisor, who has determined such information is
satisfactory to allow the lead state to comply with the
5

ENROLLED ACT NO. 64, SENATE
SIXTY-EIGHTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING
2025 GENERAL SESSION
NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
financial analysis handbook; and
(II) Whose non-United States group
wide supervisor who is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction
recognizes and accepts, as specified by the commissioner in
regulation, the group capital calculation as the world wide
group capital assessment for United States insurance groups
who operate in that jurisdiction.
(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i)(C) and
(D) of this subsection, a lead state commissioner shall
require the group capital calculation for United States
operations of any non-United States based insurance holding
company system where, after any necessary consultation with
other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by
the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and
solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the
competitiveness of the insurance marketplace;
(iii) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing
the group capital calculation stated in subparagraphs
(i)(A) through (D) of this subsection, the lead state
commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate
controlling person from filing the annual group capital
calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or
report in accordance with criteria as specified by the
commissioner in regulation;
(iv) If the commissioner determines that an
insurance holding company system no longer meets one (1) or
more of the requirements for an exemption from filing the
group capital calculation under this subsection, the
insurance holding company system shall file the group
capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless

given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on
reasonable grounds shown.
(q) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer
subject to registration and also scoped into the NAIC
liquidity stress test framework shall file the results of a
specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall be
made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the
insurance holding company system as determined by the
procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted
by the NAIC, subject to the following:
(i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework
shall include scope criteria applicable to a specific data
year. These scope criteria shall be reviewed at least
annually by the financial stability task force or its
successor. Any change to the NAIC liquidity stress test
framework or to the data year for which the scope
criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January 1
of the year following the calendar year when the changes
are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one (1) threshold of
the scope criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year
unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
or its successor, determines the insurer should not be
scoped into the framework for that data year. Similarly,
insurers that do not trigger at least one (1) threshold of
the scope criteria shall be considered scoped out of the
NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data
year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped
into the framework for that data year;
