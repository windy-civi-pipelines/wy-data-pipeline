2 commissioner shall request the calculation from the United
3 States federal reserve board under the terms of information
4 sharing agreements in effect. If the United States federal
5 reserve board cannot share the calculation with the lead
6 state commissioner, the insurance holding company system is
7 not exempt from the group capital calculation filing;
8
9 (iii) An insurance holding company system whose
10 non-United States group wide supervisor is located within a
11 reciprocal jurisdiction as described in W.S.
12 26-5-112(j)(ii) that recognizes the United States state
13 regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital;
14
15 (iv) An insurance holding company system:
16
17 (A) That provides information to the lead
18 state that meets the requirements for accreditation under
19 the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program,
20 either directly or indirectly through the group wide
21 supervisor, who has determined such information is
22 satisfactory to allow the lead state to comply with the
8 SF0050

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0007
1 NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
2 financial analysis handbook; and
3
4 (B) Whose non-United States group wide
5 supervisor who is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction
6 recognizes and accepts, as specified by the commissioner in

8 group capital assessment for United States insurance groups
9 who operate in that jurisdiction.
10
11 (v) Notwithstanding paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of
12 this subsection, a lead state commissioner shall require
13 the group capital calculation for United States operations
14 of any non-United States based insurance holding company
15 system where, after any necessary consultation with other
16 supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by the
17 lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and
18 solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the
19 competitiveness of the insurance marketplace;
20
21 (vi) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing
22 the group capital calculation stated in paragraphs (i)
23 through (iv) of this subsection, the lead state
9 SF0050

1 commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate
2 controlling person from filing the annual group capital
3 calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or
4 report in accordance with criteria as specified by the
5 commissioner in regulation;
6
7 (vii) If the commissioner determines that an
8 insurance holding company system no longer meets one (1) or
9 more of the requirements for an exemption from filing the
10 group capital calculation under this subsection, the
11 insurance holding company system shall file the group
12 capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless
13 given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on
14 reasonable grounds shown.
15
16 (q) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer
17 subject to registration and also scoped into the NAIC
18 liquidity stress test framework shall file the results of a
19 specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall be

21 insurance holding company system as determined by the
22 procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted
23 by the NAIC, subject to the following:
10 SF0050

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0007
1
2 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework
3 shall include scope criteria applicable to a specific data
4 year. These scope criteria shall be reviewed at least
5 annually by the financial stability task force or its
6 successor. Any change to the NAIC liquidity stress test
7 framework or to the data year for which the scope
8 criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January 1
9 of the year following the calendar year when the changes
10 are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one (1) threshold of
11 the scope criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
12 liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year
13 unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
14 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
15 or its successor, determines the insurer should not be
16 scoped into the framework for that data year. Similarly,
17 insurers that do not trigger at least one (1) threshold of
18 the scope criteria shall be considered scoped out of the
19 NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data
20 year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
21 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
22 or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped
23 into the framework for that data year;
11 SF0050

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0007
1
