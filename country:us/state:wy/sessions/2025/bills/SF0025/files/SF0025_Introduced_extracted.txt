16 applying for a paper certificate of title or electronic
17 certificate of title has a value less than two thousand
18 five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), a paper title or

16 SF0025

17 value may be on certified written statement obtained from a
18 properly licensed Wyoming vehicle dealer. The bond shall be
19 conditioned to indemnify a prior owner, lienholder,
20 subsequent purchaser, secured creditor or encumbrancer of
21 the vehicle and any respective successors in interest
22 against expenses, losses or damages, including reasonable
23 attorney fees, caused by the issuance of the paper

6 of the filing or issuance of the paper certificate of title
7 or electronic certificate of title as provided in this
8 section, such person shall have a right of action to seek
9 relief directly against the applicant and the surety on the
10 applicant's bond against either of whom the person damaged
11 may proceed independently of the other, but the aggregate
12 liability of the surety to any or all persons seeking
13 relief shall not exceed the total amount of the bond.
14
15 (f) If an applicant is applying for a paper
16 certificate of title or electronic certificate of title to

5 elect to submit a certified written statement obtained from
6 a properly licensed Wyoming vehicle dealer stating the

8 title or electronic certificate of title issued under this
9 subsection shall state on its face that it is
10 nontransferable for one hundred eighty (180) days from the
11 date title issued. Notwithstanding the other requirements
12 of this subsection, a vehicle shall only be eligible to be

1
2 (o) If an insurance company is unable to obtain a
3 properly endorsed certificate of title within thirty (30)
