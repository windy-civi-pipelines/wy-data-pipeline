38 residents shall not have more than ten (10) abandoned or nuisance
39 properties designated as abandoned or as a nuisance at the same
40 time. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the

42
43 (b) In determining whether a property is abandoned under
44 subsection (a) of this section, a city or town shall examine the
1

1 property and determine whether the property is occupied by the
2 property owner or by permission of the property owner. In
3 determining whether a property is a nuisance under subsection (a)
4 of this section, a city or town shall consider whether an
5 unreasonable or unlawful use or condition of the property has
6 resulted or may result in an economic or physical injury to a
7 neighboring property owner or endangers the life, health or safety
8 of the community.
9
10 (c) If the owner of an abandoned or nuisance property makes
11 an expenditure to demolish the property and remove all demolished
12 material within two (2) years after the property is designated as
13 abandoned or as a nuisance under subsection (a) of this section
14 and submits proof of the expenditure to the governing body of the
15 city or town for approval under subsection (f) of this section,
16 the owner shall be eligible for a tax credit as provided in W.S.
17 39-13-109(d)(ii) in an amount not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of
18 the expenditures to demolish the property and remove all demolished
19 material.
20
21 (d) If the owner of an abandoned or nuisance property makes
22 an expenditure to bring the property into substantial compliance
23 with applicable codes within two (2) years after the property is
24 designated as abandoned or as a nuisance under subsection (a) of
25 this section and submits proof of the expenditure to the governing
26 body of the city or town for approval under subsection (f) of this
27 section, the owner shall be eligible for a tax credit as provided
28 in W.S. 39-13-109(d)(ii) in an amount not to exceed the amount
29 expended to bring the property into substantial compliance with
30 applicable codes.
31
32 (e) Any person who purchases or takes ownership of an
33 abandoned or nuisance property after the property has been
34 designated as abandoned or as a nuisance under subsection (a) of
35 this section and who demolishes the property and removes all
36 demolished material or brings the property into substantial
37 compliance with applicable codes within five (5) years after the
38 person initially purchased or took ownership of the property shall
39 be eligible for a tax credit as provided in W.S. 39-13-109(d)(ii)
40 in an amount not to exceed the amount expended to demolish the
41 property and remove all demolished material or bring the property
42 into substantial compliance with applicable codes.
43
44 (f) Prior to being eligible for any tax credit under
45 subsections (c) through (e) of this section, the person claiming
46 the credit shall document the person's expenditures resulting from
47 the actions required by subsections (c) through (e) of this section
2

1 and submit proof of the expenditures to the governing body of the
2 city or town for approval. Only approved expenditures shall be
3 eligible for a tax credit. The governing body shall not approve
4 any expenditures that do not directly relate to the actions
5 required by subsections (c) through (e) of this section. The
6 governing body shall not approve any expenditures made after the
7 applicable time limit specified in subsections (c) through (e) of
