13 account to the department of revenue to be expended only for
14 payments to qualifying counties under this section. This
15 appropriation shall not be transferred or expended for any other
16 purpose. Notwithstanding W.S. 9-2-1008, 9-2-1012(e) and 9-4-207,
17 any unexpended, unobligated funds remaining from this
18 appropriation shall not revert until June 30, 2027. It is the

22
23 (b) The department of revenue shall establish a grant
24 application and program for distribution of the funds appropriated
25 in subsection (a) of this section and as specified in this
26 subsection. Not more than one-half (1/2) of the amount appropriated
27 in subsection (a) of this section may be distributed for purposes
28 of restoring revenue attributable to any reduction in residential
29 property tax assessments from tax year 2025. Any remaining funds
30 from the appropriation in subsection (a) of this section shall be
31 available for distribution for purposes of restoring revenue
32 attributable to any reduction in residential property tax
33 assessments from tax year 2026.
34
35 (c) The following shall apply to grants made under this
36 section:
37
38 (i) No school district shall qualify for a grant under

42 counties, cities and towns that are, or are located within, the

2 shall qualify for grants under this section;
3
4 (iii) Only counties, cities and towns within the
5 counties qualifying under paragraph (ii) of this subsection that
6 also each impose the maximum statutory mill levy authorized to be
7 imposed by the applicable governing board shall qualify for grants
8 under this section;
9
10 (iv) Any special district that also imposes the maximum
11 statutory mill levy authorized to be imposed by the applicable
12 governing board shall qualify for grants under this section.
13
14 (d) Counties shall prepare a grant application to the
15 department of revenue on behalf of the county and all cities, towns
16 and qualifying special districts located in the county. If awarded
17 grant funds under this section, the county shall distribute the
18 funds in proportion to the demonstrated reduction in residential
19 property tax assessments as compared to tax year 2024 and directly
20 attributable to legislation exempting or otherwise reducing
21 residential property tax assessments enacted during the 2025
22 general session.
23
24 (e) Grants awarded under this section shall not exceed an
25 amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the demonstrated
26 reduction of residential property tax assessments as compared to
27 tax year 2024 and directly attributable to this act or legislation
28 exempting or otherwise reducing residential property tax
29 assessments enacted during the 2025 general session. If funds
30 appropriated under subsection (a) of this section and allocated
31 for tax years 2025 and 2026 are insufficient to restore the
32 demonstrated reduced residential property tax assessments under
33 this section, the department of revenue shall make the grant awards
34 on a pro rata basis.
35
36 (f) The department of revenue shall administer the program
37 under this section and shall promulgate all rules necessary to
38 implement this section.". LARSON, JT
