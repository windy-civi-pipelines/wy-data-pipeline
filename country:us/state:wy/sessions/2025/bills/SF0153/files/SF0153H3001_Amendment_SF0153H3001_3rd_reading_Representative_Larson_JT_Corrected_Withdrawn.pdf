8 (a) There is appropriated seventy-two million dollars
9 ($72,000,000.00) from the legislative stabilization reserve
10 account to the department of revenue to be expended only for
11 payments to qualifying counties under this section. This
12 appropriation shall not be transferred or expended for any other
13 purpose. Notwithstanding W.S. 9-2-1008, 9-2-1012(e) and 9-4-207,
14 any unexpended, unobligated funds remaining from this
15 appropriation shall not revert until June 30, 2027. It is the
16 intent of the legislature that this appropriation not be included
17 in the standard budget of the department of revenue for the
18 immediately succeeding fiscal biennium.
19
20 (b) The department of revenue shall establish a grant
21 application and program for distribution of the funds appropriated
22 in subsection (a) of this section and as specified in this
23 subsection. Not more than one-half (1/2) of the amount appropriated
24 in subsection (a) of this section may be distributed for purposes
25 of restoring revenue attributable to any reduction in residential
26 property tax assessments from tax year 2025. Any remaining funds
27 from the appropriation in subsection (a) of this section shall be
28 available for distribution for purposes of restoring revenue
29 attributable to any reduction in residential property tax
30 assessments from tax year 2026.
31
32 (c) The following shall apply to grants made under this
33 section:
34
35 (i) No school district shall qualify for a grant under
36 this section;
37
38 (ii) Subject to paragraph (iii) of this subsection,
39 counties, cities and towns that are, or are located within, the
40 counties with the eight (8) lowest total assessed valuations for
41 the current tax year, as certified by the department of revenue,

43
1

1 (iii) Only counties, cities and towns within the
2 counties qualifying under paragraph (ii) of this subsection that
3 also each impose the maximum statutory mill levy authorized to be
4 imposed by the applicable governing board shall qualify for grants
5 under this section;
6
7 (iv) Any special district that also imposes the maximum
8 statutory mill levy authorized to be imposed by the applicable
9 governing board shall qualify for grants under this section.
10
11 (d) Counties shall prepare a grant application to the
12 department of revenue on behalf of the county and all cities, towns
13 and qualifying special districts located in the county. If awarded
14 grant funds under this section, the county shall distribute the
15 funds in proportion to the demonstrated reduction in residential
16 property tax assessments as compared to tax year 2024 and directly
17 attributable to legislation exempting or otherwise reducing
18 residential property tax assessments enacted during the 2025
19 general session.
20
21 (e) Grants awarded under this section shall not exceed an
22 amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the demonstrated
23 reduction of residential property tax assessments as compared to
24 tax year 2024 and directly attributable to this act or legislation
25 exempting or otherwise reducing residential property tax
26 assessments enacted during the 2025 general session. If funds
27 appropriated under subsection (a) of this section and allocated
28 for tax years 2025 and 2026 are insufficient to restore the
29 demonstrated reduced residential property tax assessments under
30 this section, the department of revenue shall make the grant awards
31 on a pro rata basis.
32
33 (f) The department of revenue shall administer the program
34 under this section and shall promulgate all rules necessary to
35 implement this section.".
