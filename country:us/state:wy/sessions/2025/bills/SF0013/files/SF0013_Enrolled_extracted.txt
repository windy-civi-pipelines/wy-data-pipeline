curricula aligned to the uniform content and performance

and shall include evidence based interventions to
facilitate skill‑specific remediation of any reading
difficulty as early as possible.
(b) As soon as practicable after the assessment or

explanation of the screening results, to the parent,

the middle of the school year in kindergarten through the
end of grade three (3) to remedy the reading related
difficulty utilizing an appropriate evidence based
intervention program, which may include a group reading
plan that does not occur during literacy core instructional
time. For students under an individualized education
program (IEP) which addresses reading difficulties, the IEP
shall be deemed sufficient to meet the requirements of this
subsection and no additional plan shall be required.
(c) Each district shall annually report to the
department of education on the progress of each of its
schools toward achieving the goal of eighty-five percent
(85%) of all students reading at grade level upon
completion of the third grade. This report shall include

percent (85%) proficiency in the specific skills known to
be predictive of grade three (3) reading proficiency and
that are listed in subsection (d) of this section. This
report shall also include grade three (3) reading
proficiency shall be determined by the grade three (3)
statewide assessment administered pursuant to W.S.
21-2-304(a)(v). Each school not meeting the eighty-five
percent (85%) goal specified under this subsection shall
submit an improvement plan to the school district, and the
school district shall submit an overall improvement plan to
the department. At a minimum, each school and district
improvement plan shall outline its general strategy for
increasing reading proficiency for the next school year and
shall specifically address the evidence based program of
instruction, assessment and intervention being implemented,
and the specific training in those programs that reading
teachers have received., the student-teacher ratio, the use
of certified tutors and the use of instructional
facilitators and paraprofessionals in kindergarten through
grade three (3) trained in the delivery of the evidence
