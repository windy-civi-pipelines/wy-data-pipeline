6 (a) That the Wyoming State Legislature adopts the
7 application made under section 1 of this joint resolution,
8 expressly subject to the following reservations,
9 understandings and declarations:
10
11 (i) An application to the United States Congress
12 to call a convention of the several states under Article V of
13 the United States Constitution for the purpose of proposing
14 amendments to the United States Constitution confers no power
15 to Congress other than the power to call the convention. The
16 power of Congress to exercise this ministerial duty consists
17 solely of the authority to name a reasonable time and place
18 for the initial meeting of a convention;
19
20 (ii) Congress does not have the power or the
21 authority to determine any rules for the governing of an
22 amendment convention of the several states called under
23 Article V of the United States Constitution. Congress does

SJ0005

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0726
1 not have the power to set the number of delegates to be sent
2 by any state to a convention, nor does Congress have the power
3 to name delegates to a convention. The power to name delegates
4 remains exclusively within the authority of the legislatures
5 of the several states;
6
7 (iii) By definition, a convention of the several
8 states to propose amendments to the United States
9 Constitution means that states shall vote on the basis of one
10 (1) state, one (1) vote;
11
12 (iv) A convention of the several states to propose
13 amendments to the United States Constitution convened under
14 this application shall be limited to consideration of the
15 specific topic expressly specified in section 1 of this joint
16 resolution and no other. This application is made with the
17 express understanding that an amendment that in any way seeks
18 to amend, modify or repeal any provision of the Bill of Rights
19 shall not be authorized for consideration in any manner;
20
21 (v) Under Article V of the United States
22 Constitution, Congress may determine whether the proposed
23 amendment shall be ratified by the legislatures of the several
4

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0726
1 states or by special state ratification conventions. The
2 Wyoming State Legislature recommends that Congress select
3 ratification by the legislatures of the several states;
4
5 (vi) The Wyoming State Legislature may provide
6 further instructions to its delegates and may recall its
7 delegates at any time for a breach of a duty or a violation
8 of the instructions provided to the delegates, including but
9 not limited to the instructions and requirements specified in
10 W.S. 9-22-101 and 9-22-102.
11
12 (b) That this application be considered as covering the
13 same subject matter as the applications from other states to
14 Congress to call a convention to set a limit on the number of
15 terms that a person may be elected to the United States House
16 of Representatives and the United States Senate, and that
17 this application be aggregated with the applications of other
18 states for the purposes of attaining the two-thirds (2/3) of
19 states necessary to require Congress to call a limited
20 convention for the purpose of setting term limits on the
21 members of Congress, but that this application not be
22 aggregated with any other application on any other subject.

5 on the same subject.
6

8 transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the
9 United States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker
