28 application and program for distribution of the funds appropriated

30 subsection. Not more than one-half (1/2) of the amount appropriated

21
22 (d) Counties qualified under subsection (c) of this section
23 shall prepare a grant application to the department of revenue on
24 behalf of the county and all cities, towns and qualifying special
25 districts in the county. If awarded grant funds under this section,
26 the county shall distribute the funds in proportion to the
