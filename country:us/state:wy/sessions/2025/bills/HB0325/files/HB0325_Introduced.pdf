13 recent rate case determination.
14
15 (b) Except as provided by W.S. 37-2-205.2, no public

19 first obtained from the commission a certificate that
20 public convenience and necessity require the exercise of
21 such right and privilege; provided, that when the
22 commission shall find, after hearing, that a public utility
23 has heretofore begun actual construction work and is

3 the undertaking, under any franchise or permit heretofore
4 granted but not heretofore actually exercised, such public
5 utility may proceed to the completion of such work, and
6 may, after such completion exercise such right or
7 privilege; and provided, further, that this section shall
8 not be construed to validate any right or privilege now
