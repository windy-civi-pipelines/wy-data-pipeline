2 and
3
4 WHEREAS, the Wyoming Constitution recognizes that "equality
5 in the enjoyment of natural and civil rights is only made
6 sure through political equality"; and
7
8 WHEREAS, the people of Wyoming have compelling sovereign
9 interests in fostering robust political debate and self-
10 government, protecting the free speech interests of all
11 individuals, securing the liberty and political equality of
12 Wyoming's citizens, guarding against corruption and advancing
13 federalism and the interests of the several states; and
14
15 WHEREAS, reasonable limits on how money is used to influence
16 the outcomes of elections may be wise to secure the interests
17 of all citizens of Wyoming to be represented and participate
18 in elections and self-government, to protect the integrity of
19 elections and government against out-of-state and foreign
20 interests and undue influence of wealthy special interests,

1
2 WHEREAS, over the past five (5) decades, the United States
3 Supreme Court has gradually come to equate unlimited election
4 spending with "free speech," contrary to the original public
5 meaning of the First Amendment to the United States
6 Constitution. This unlimited spending is drowning out the
7 free speech interests of actual constituents, narrowing
8 debate, weakening federalism and self-governance in the
9 states and increasing the risk of systemic corruption; and
10
11 WHEREAS, the framers to the United States Constitution wisely
12 granted the states the power to amend the Constitution when
13 necessary to make it, and our Union, ever more perfect and to
14 protect and preserve self-government and liberty; and
15
16 WHEREAS, a Constitutional amendment would control over United
17 States Supreme Court precedent interpreting the United States
18 Constitution.

3 the United States to propose and send to the states for
4 ratification an amendment to the United States Constitution
5 to provide that the states and Congress, within their
6 respective jurisdictions, may establish reasonable limits on
7 the spending of money to influence elections and that, in so
8 doing, the states and Congress may distinguish between
9 natural persons and artificial entities, including
10 corporations, unions and artificial intelligence.
11
12 Section 2. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming
13 transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the
14 United States, to the President of the Senate, the majority
15 leader and minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the
16 House of Representatives and the majority leader and minority
