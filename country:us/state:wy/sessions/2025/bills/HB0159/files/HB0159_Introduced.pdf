18 declared invalid or unconstitutional, even if that federal

20 repealed, superseded or declared invalid or
21 unconstitutional when the cause of action accrued.
22

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354

11 policy and shall not be enforceable in any court.
12

5
6 (iii) Each officer and employee of the state and
7 its political subdivisions shall have official immunity,

9 appropriate;
10
11 (iv) The immunity conferred under this
12 subsection shall apply to:
13
14 (A) Any action, claim or counterclaim
15 brought under this section;
16
17 (B) Any type of legal or equitable action

19 federal court and which may not be abrogated by Congress or
20 by any state or federal court except pursuant to
21 congressional legislation authorized by section 5 of the
22 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States constitution, by
23 the bankruptcy clause of article I of the United States
15 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354

19 relief specified in this subsection shall be litigated on
20 behalf of a plaintiff or defendant class, notwithstanding
21 rule 23 of the Wyoming rules of civil procedure. No court
22 shall certify a plaintiff or defendant class in any action
23 seeking the relief specified in this subsection.
17 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1
2 (k) Nothing in this article shall be construed to
3 prevent a litigant from asserting the invalidity or
4 unconstitutionality of any provision or application of this
5 article as a defense to any action, claim or counterclaim
6 brought against that litigant.
7
8 (m) Recognizing Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137
9 (1996), where the United States supreme court held that, in
10 the context of determining the severability of a state
11 statute regulating abortion, an explicit statement of
12 legislative intent is controlling, it is the intent of the
13 legislature that every provision, section, subsection,
14 sentence, clause, phrase or word in this article, and every
15 application of the provisions of this article to every
16 person, group of persons or circumstances, are severable
17 from each other. The following shall apply to this article:
18
19 (i) If any application of any provision in this
20 article to any person, group of persons or circumstances is
21 found by a court to be invalid, preempted or
22 unconstitutional for any reason whatsoever, then the
23 remaining applications of that provision to all other
18 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1 persons and circumstances shall be severed and preserved
2 and shall remain in effect. All constitutionally valid
3 applications of the provisions in this article shall be
4 severed from any applications that a court finds to be
5 invalid, preempted or unconstitutional because it is the
6 legislature's intent and priority that every single valid
7 application of every statutory provision be allowed to
8 stand alone;
9
10 (ii) The legislature further declares that it
11 would have enacted this article and each provision,
12 section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word, and
13 all constitutional applications of the provisions of this
14 article, irrespective of the fact that any provision,
15 section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word, or
16 applications of this article, were declared to be invalid,
17 preempted or unconstitutional;
18
19 (iii) If any provision of this article is found
20 by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the
21 applications of that provision that do not present
22 unconstitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and
19 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1 remain in force, consistent with the severability
2 requirements of this subsection;
3
4 (iv) No court shall decline to enforce the
5 severability requirements of this subsection on the ground
6 that severing would rewrite the statute or involve the
7 court in legislative or lawmaking activity. A court that
8 declines to enforce or that enjoins a state official from
9 enforcing a statutory provision is never rewriting a
10 statute or engaging in legislative or lawmaking activity,
11 as the statute continues to contain the same words as
12 before the court's decision. A judicial injunction or
13 declaration of unconstitutionality:
14
15 (A) Is nothing more than an edict
16 prohibiting enforcement of the disputed statute against the
17 named parties to that lawsuit, which may subsequently be
18 vacated by a later court if that court has a different
19 understanding of the requirements of the Wyoming
20 constitution or the United States constitution;
21
22 (B) Is not a formal amendment of the
23 language in a statute; and
20 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1
2 (C) No more rewrites a statute than a
3 decision by the executive branch not to enforce a duly
4 enacted statute in a limited and defined set of
5 circumstances.
6
7 (v) If any state or federal court disregards any
8 of the severability requirements of this subsection and
9 declares or finds any provision of this article facially
10 invalid, preempted or unconstitutional when there are
11 discrete applications of that provision that can be
12 enforced against a person, group of persons or
13 circumstances without violating federal law, the United
14 States constitution or the Wyoming constitution, then that
15 provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law,
16 as if the legislature had enacted a provision limited to
17 the persons, group of persons or circumstances for which
18 the provision's application will not violate federal law,
19 the United States constitution or the Wyoming constitution.
20 Every court and every state official shall adopt this
21 saving construction of that provision until the court
22 ruling that pronounced the provision facially invalid,
21 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1 preempted or unconstitutional is vacated, overruled or
2 abrogated.
3
4 Section 2. W.S. 35-6-133 and 35-11-302(a) by creating
5 a new paragraph (xii) are amended to read:
6
7 35-6-133. Rules and regulations for disposal of
8 bodies and parts thereof.
9
10 The state department of health may shall prescribe rules
11 and regulations for the disposal of the bodies, tissues,
12 organs and parts thereof of an unborn child, human fetus or
13 human embryo which has been aborted.
14
15 35-11-302. Administrator's authority to recommend
16 standards, rules, regulations or permits.
17
18 (a) The administrator, after receiving public comment
19 and after consultation with the advisory board, shall
20 recommend to the director rules, regulations, standards and
21 permit systems to promote the purposes of this act. Such
22 rules, regulations, standards and permit systems shall
23 prescribe:
22 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1
2 (xii) Standards for the collection and disposal
3 of discarded abortion drugs as defined by W.S.
4 35-6-201(a)(ii) and for the mitigation and remediation
5 necessary to address the environmental effects of abortion
6 drugs that are discharged into any disposal system,
7 sewerage system, public water supply, community water
8 system or the waters of the state. Rules promulgated under
9 this paragraph shall include requirements for the testing
10 of community water systems and public water supplies to
11 ensure that endocrine-disrupting chemical byproducts of
12 abortion drugs do not enter a water system or water supply.
13
14 Section 3.
15
16 (a) The department of health shall promulgate all
17 rules within its authority necessary to implement this act.
18
19 (b) The environmental quality council, upon
20 recommendation from the department of environmental
21 quality, shall promulgate all rules within its authority
22 necessary to implement this act.
23
23 HB0159

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0354
1 Section 4. This act is effective immediately upon
2 completion of all acts necessary for a bill to become law
