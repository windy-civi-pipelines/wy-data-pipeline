41 thereof for the use of the district, or for the purchase of any
42 materials, machinery, or apparatus, such district shall cause
43 estimates of the cost thereof to be made by some competent engineer
44 or engineers and if such estimated cost shall exceed the sum of
1

1 one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) twenty thousand dollars
2 ($20,000.00) no such contract shall be entered into for a price,
3 cost or consideration exceeding such estimate nor without
4 advertising for sealed bids. Prior to such advertisement, plans
5 and specifications for the proposed construction work or materials
6 shall be prepared and filed at the principal office or place of
7 business of the district. Such advertisement shall be inserted for
8 three (3) consecutive issues, with not less than twenty (20) days
9 intervening between the first and last publication dates, in one
10 (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the district and,
11 in the discretion of the board of directors of the district, in
12 such additional newspapers or trade or technical periodicals as
13 may be selected by the board in order to give proper notice of the
14 receiving of bids. Such advertisement shall designate the nature
15 of the construction work proposed to be done or materials proposed
16 to be purchased; that the plans and specifications therefor may be
17 inspected at the office of the district, giving the location
18 thereof, and shall designate the time within which bids shall be
19 filed and the date, hour and place the same shall be opened. The
20 board of directors of the district, with the assistance of the
21 state engineer, whose duty it shall be to supervise such lettings,
22 may let the contract for such work or materials to the lowest
23 responsible bidder, or, in the sole discretion of the board, all
24 bids tendered may be rejected and readvertisement for bids made in
25 the manner, form and time in this section provided. No such
26 contract shall be valid nor shall any money of the district be
27 expended thereunder unless advertisement and letting shall have
28 been had as in this section provided. Such contract shall provide
29 that wherever possible workmen who are citizens of Wyoming shall
30 be employed by the contractor. All provisions of W.S. 16-6-112
31 through 16-6-115, with reference to contractor's bonds, shall be
32 applicable and effective as to any contract let pursuant to the
33 provisions of this act; provided further, that if all or a portion
34 of the cost of the proposed works is to be met by grant of labor
35 or a grant in aid from a federal or state agency, the rules and
36 regulations of which agency provide that work shall not be done by
37 contract, the board may proceed with the necessary construction or
38 other work without first complying with any of the foregoing
39 provisions of this section.".
