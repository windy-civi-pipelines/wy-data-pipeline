applicable and effective as to any contract let pursuant to
the provisions of this act; provided further, that if all
or a portion of the cost of the proposed works is to be met
by grant of labor or a grant in aid from a federal or state
agency, the rules and regulations of which agency provide
that work shall not be done by contract, the board may
proceed with the necessary construction or other work

responsible bidder submitting the lowest and best bid upon
proper terms after due public notice by publication has
been given asking for competitive bids. The district shall
have the right to reject any and all bids and to waive any
irregularity in any bid. Any contract may be let on a lump
sum or unit basis. No contract shall be entered into for
such work unless the contractor shall give an undertaking
with a sufficient surety or sureties approved by the board

performance of the contract. Upon default in the
performance of any contract, the proper official may
advertise and relet the remainder of the work without

contract price and recover any excess cost by suit on the
original bond, or otherwise. The district shall have the
