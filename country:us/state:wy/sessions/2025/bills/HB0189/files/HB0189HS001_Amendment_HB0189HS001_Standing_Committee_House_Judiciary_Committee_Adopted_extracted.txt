21 reasonable. The ability of a parent or legal guardian to bring a
22 civil action on behalf of the minor shall not preclude the minor

24 majority. This civil cause of action is independent of criminal
25 proceedings and may be brought by the minor or the minor's parent
26 or legal guardian regardless of whether criminal charges have been
