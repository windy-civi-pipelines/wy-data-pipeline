11
12 (a) There is created Wyoming's next generation account. The
13 account shall consist of all funds transferred or appropriated to
14 the account by law. All monies deposited or transferred into the
15 account are inviolate and constitute a permanent or perpetual trust
16 fund, subject to the provisions for the withdrawal of funds
17 provided by this section.
18
19 (b) The state treasurer shall invest all funds within
20 Wyoming's next generation account in accordance with W.S.
21 9-4-715(a) and (c) through (e) and 9-4-716. W.S. 9-4-716(e) shall
22 not apply to the account. The state treasurer, or the treasurer's
23 designee, which shall be registered under the federal Investment
24 Advisor's Act of 1940, as amended and if required to be registered
25 by the terms of that act, may invest the unobligated, unencumbered
26 balance of the account in equities, including stocks of
27 corporations. The account shall be invested so that the overall
28 risk profile of the account's investments shall not materially
29 exceed the risk profile of a reference portfolio that consists of
30 eighty-five percent (85%) private equity and fifteen percent (15%)
31 private credit investments. In adopting investment policy
32 statements for the account, the board shall seek to preserve the
33 balance of the account in a manner that strives for the highest
34 possible risk-adjusted total net return consistent with an
35 appropriate level of safety and liquidity, giving consideration to
36 the account's potential extended investment period and the
37 extended period during which monies in the account may be
38 ineligible for withdrawal.
39
40 (c) Beginning on July 1, 2026 and annually on each July 1
41 thereafter until fourteen (14) fiscal years have elapsed,
42 transfers shall be made by the state auditor from the legislative
43 stabilization reserve account to Wyoming's next generation account

10 ($75,000,000.00), if the balance of the legislative stabilization
11 reserve account exceeds one billion five hundred million dollars

13 hundred fifty million dollars ($1,750,000,000.00);

19 dollars ($1,500,000,000.00);
20
21 (D) Twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00),
22 if the balance of the legislative stabilization reserve account

24 or equal to one billion two hundred fifty million dollars
25 ($1,250,000,000.00);
26
27 (E) Zero dollars ($0.00), only if the balance of
28 the legislative stabilization reserve account is equal to or less
29 than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000.00).
30
31 (ii) Transfers shall be made under this subsection if
32 funds are available from the legislative stabilization reserve
33 account;

37 legislative stabilization reserve account required by law are
38 made.
39
40
41 (d) Transfers made under subsection (c) of this section, and
42 the investment of those transfers, shall be in accordance with all
43 of the following:

46 each annual transfer made under subsection (c) of this section and
2
1 shall separately account for all earnings from each annual
2 transfer;

4 (ii) Annual transfers shall not be withdrawn from the
5 account;
6
7 (iii) Investment earnings from each annual transfer

12 years have elapsed, all investment earnings in Wyoming's next
13 generation account arising from the annual transfer to the account
14 made fourteen (14) fiscal years earlier shall be deposited in the

26 associated with making the deposit required under this subsection.
