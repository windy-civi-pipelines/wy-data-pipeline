13 addition to the following exceptions:
14
15 (i) Performing a pre-viability separation procedure
16 necessary in the physician's reasonable medical judgment to
17 prevent the death of the pregnant woman, a substantial risk of
18 death for the pregnant woman because of a physical condition or
19 the serious and permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ of
20 the pregnant woman, provided that no separation procedure shall be
21 deemed necessary under this paragraph unless the physician makes
22 all reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve
23 both the life of the pregnant woman and the life of the unborn
24 baby in a manner consistent with reasonable medical judgment;

26 (ii) Providing medical treatment to a pregnant woman
27 that results in the accidental or unintentional injury to, or the

31 pregnancy is the result of incest as defined by W.S. 6-4-402 or
32 sexual assault as defined by W.S. 6-2-301(a)(v). Prior to the
33 performance of any abortion under this paragraph the woman, or the

35 a guardianship, shall report the act of incest or sexual assault
36 to a law enforcement agency and a copy of the report shall be

43
44 (b) The legislature finds that:
1
1
2 (i) As a consequence of an unborn baby being a member
3 of the species home sapiens from conception, an unborn baby is a
4 member of the human race under article 1, section 2 of the Wyoming
5 constitution;
6
7 (ii) The legislature acknowledges that all members of
8 the human race are created equal and are endowed by their creator

12 (iii) This act promotes and furthers article 1, section
13 6 of the Wyoming constitution, which guarantees that no person may
14 be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law;
15
16 (iv) Regarding article 1, section 38 of the Wyoming
17 constitution, abortion as defined in this act is not health care.

23 and general welfare of the people requires the prohibition of
24 abortion as defined in this act;
25

39 omitted);
