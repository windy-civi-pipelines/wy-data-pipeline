3 "(a) For purposes of definition, interpretation and
4 construction under the Wyoming constitution and all statutes of
5 this state:
6
7 (i) "Health care" shall mean acting to promote the
8 curative, improving, healing, restorative and therapeutic physical
9 health and well-being of a person, including an unborn person from
10 the moment of conception herein defined as "life." "Health care"
11 shall not mean actions that terminate life, and are hereby
12 prohibited, except as provided in this section. Abortion, as
13 defined by paragraph (ii) of this subsection, shall be defined as
14 health care only if the abortion is medically necessary to save
15 the life of a pregnant woman by performing a pre-viability
16 separation procedure necessary in the physician's reasonable
17 judgment to prevent the death of the pregnant woman, a substantial
18 risk of death for the pregnant woman because of a physical
19 condition or the serious and permanent impairment of a life-
20 sustaining organ of a pregnant woman, provided that no separation
21 procedure shall be deemed necessary under this section unless the
22 physician makes all reasonable medical efforts under the
23 circumstances to preserve both the life of the pregnant woman and
24 the life of the unborn baby in a manner consistent with reasonable
25 medical judgment;
26
27 (ii) "Abortion" shall mean an act, procedure, device or
28 prescription administered to or prescribed for a pregnant woman by
29 any person with knowledge of the pregnancy, including the pregnant
30 woman herself, with the intent of producing the premature
31 expulsion, removal or termination of a human embryo or fetus,
32 except that in cases in which the viability of the embryo or fetus
33 is threatened by continuation of the pregnancy, early delivery
34 after viability by commonly accepted obstetrical practices shall
35 not be construed as an abortion;".
