10 fund reserve account. All funds within the account shall be
11 invested by the state treasurer as authorized under W.S. 9-4-
12 715(a), (d), (e) and (r) and all investment earnings from the
13 account shall be credited to the account. Except for funds

15 permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund investment earnings and funds
16 to be transferred into the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund,

20 and each fiscal year thereafter, to the extent funds are available,
21 the state treasurer shall transfer unobligated funds from this
22 account to the general fund on a quarterly, pro-rata basis as
23 necessary to ensure that an amount equal to two and one-half
24 percent (2.5%) of the previous five (5) year average market value
25 of the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, calculated on the
26 first day of the fiscal year, is available for expenditure during
27 each fiscal year. As soon as possible after the end of each of the
28 fiscal years beginning on and after July 1, 2017, after making any
29 transfer required pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this
30 subsection, revenues in this account in excess of two hundred
31 forty-five percent (245%) of the spending policy amount in
32 subsection (d) of this section shall be credited to the permanent
33 Wyoming mineral trust fund. For fiscal year 2020 and for each
34 fiscal year: thereafter:

37 year, after making any other transfers provided by law from the
38 permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund reserve account, but prior to
39 calculating the balance of the account under this subsection, the
40 state treasurer shall transfer from the account an amount equal to
41 the difference between the maximum amount amounts which may be
42 credited to the strategic investments and projects account and the
43 legislative stabilization reserve account pursuant to subsection
44 (q) of this section and the amount amounts actually credited to
