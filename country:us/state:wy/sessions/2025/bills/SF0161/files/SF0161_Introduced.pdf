18 taxation in subparagraph (iii)(C) of this subsection:
19

21 market value of residential real property shall be
22 determined as follows:
23
14 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 (I) For any residential real property
2 that was last acquired on or before December 31, 2019, the
3 base year value for the residential real property shall be
4 equal to the fair market value of the property on January
5 1, 2019;
6
7 (II) For any residential real property
8 that was last acquired on or after January 1, 2020 and on
9 or before December 31, 2025, the base year value for the
10 residential real property shall be equal to the fair market
11 value of the property on January 1 of the year the property
12 was last acquired;
13
14 (III) For any residential real
15 property that is acquired on or after January 1, 2026,
16 there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
17 acquisition value of the property is the fair market value
18 of the property and the acquisition value shall be used as
19 the base year value for the property except as provided in
20 subdivision (IV) of this subparagraph;
21
22 (IV) Notwithstanding subdivision (III)
23 of this subparagraph, for any residential real property
15 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 that is acquired on or after January 1, 2026, the base year
2 value for the residential real property shall be equal to
3 the fair market value of the property on January 1 of the
4 year the property was acquired if:
5
6 (1) The presumption under
7 subdivision (III) of this subparagraph is rebutted by a
8 preponderance of the evidence showing that the acquisition
9 price paid to acquire the property was not fair market
10 value because a party to the transaction was acting under
11 undue influence or the terms of the transaction were not
12 negotiated at arms-length between an informed buyer and
13 seller; or
14
15 (2) The owner of the residential
16 real property does not submit information that is
17 sufficient to establish the acquisition value of the
18 residential real property under subdivision (III) of this
19 subparagraph. The department shall promulgate rules
20 regarding the documentation and procedures required to
21 establish acquisition value under this paragraph.
22
16 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 (B) The base year value determined under
2 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be adjusted as
3 necessary to account for increases in the value of the
4 property caused by new construction or significant
5 additions to the residential real property. The value of
6 the new construction or significant additions shall be
7 added to the base year value of the residential real
8 property. The value of the new construction or significant
9 additions shall be determined by the construction costs.
10 The department shall adopt rules specifying how
11 construction costs are determined. Actual costs may be
12 submitted to determine construction costs. If actual costs
13 are not submitted or if the construction costs do not
14 represent fair value because a party to the transaction was
15 acting under undue influence or the terms of the
16 transaction were not negotiated at arms-length, the
17 construction costs shall be determined based on average
18 construction costs in the state for the applicable tax
19 year. The department shall adopt rules specifying how
20 significant additions to residential real property and
21 construction costs are reported. As used in this
22 subdivision, "significant addition" means any construction
23 of real property that adds habitable square feet to the
17 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 residential real property and includes construction where
2 all or a portion of the residential real property is
3 demolished and reconstructed. "Significant addition" shall
4 not include finishing an unfinished portion of an existing
5 residential property;
6
7 (C) The amount determined pursuant to
8 subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall be the
9 fair market value of the residential real property until
10 ownership of the property is transferred to a new person.
11 Each time residential real property is transferred to a new
12 person, the property shall be valued as provided in
13 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to determine the new
14 base year value of the property. The new base year value of
15 the property shall be subject to any adjustment required by
16 subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in subsequent tax years;
17
18 (D) As used in this paragraph:
19
20 (I) "Acquisition value" means the
21 actual full amount paid or to be paid to acquire
22 residential real property;
23
18 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 (II) "Residential real property" means
2 real property improved by a dwelling designed to house not
3 more than four (4) families and includes a detached garage
4 owned by the owner of the dwelling and any associated
5 residential land up to thirty-five (35) acres where the
6 dwelling is located if the land is owned by the owner of
7 the dwelling. The dwelling may include any type of
8 residence including a single family home, an individual
9 condominium unit, a mobile home or a trailer if the
10 dwelling is used as a primary residence;
11
12 (III) "Transfer" or "acquisition" of
13 residential real property does not include:
14
15 (1) A transfer of property
16 between spouses;
17
18 (2) A transfer of property
19 pursuant to a court order including to effectuate a
20 settlement agreement or in compliance with a decree of
21 divorce or judicial separation;
22
19 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 (3) A transfer of property to a
2 trust established for the benefit of the prior owner;
3
4 (4) A transfer of property to a
5 corporation, partnership or limited liability company if
6 the prior owner of the property is a shareholder or owner
7 of the corporation, partnership or limited liability
8 company;
9
10 (5) Any other transfer of
11 property that the department determines by rule should not
12 be an acquisition of property due to the relationship of
13 the parties or other factors.
14
15 39-13-109. Taxpayer remedies.
16
17 (b) Appeals. The following shall apply:
18
19 (i) Any person wishing to contest an assessment
20 of his property shall file not later than thirty (30) days
21 after the date of the assessment schedule properly sent
22 pursuant to W.S. 39-13-103(b)(vii), a statement with the
23 county assessor specifying the reasons why the assessment
20 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682
1 is incorrect. For purposes of this paragraph, if a
2 statement of reasons is mailed or sent by electronic
3 transmission by the person assessed, it shall be deemed
4 timely filed if it is postmarked or transmitted not later
5 than thirty (30) days after the mailing or the electronic
6 transmission of the notification of the assessment
7 schedule. The county assessor shall provide a copy to the
8 county clerk as clerk of the county board of equalization.
9 The county assessor and the person contesting the
10 assessment, or his agent, shall disclose witnesses and
11 exchange information, evidence and documents relevant to
12 the appeal, including sales information from relevant
13 statements of consideration if requested, no later than
14 thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled county board of
15 equalization hearing. The assessor shall specifically
16 identify the sales information used to determine market
17 value of the property under appeal. A county board of
18 equalization may receive evidence relative to any
19 assessment and may require the person assessed or his agent
20 or attorney to appear before it, be examined and produce
21 any documents relating to the assessment. The appeal may be
22 dismissed if any person willfully neglects or refuses to
23 attend a meeting of a county board of equalization and be
21 SF0161

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0682

10 repetitious, including expert opinion testimony, to rebut
11 the presumption in favor of a valuation asserted by the
12 county assessor or related to the presumption in W.S.
13 39-13-103(b)(xviii)(A)(III). The county attorney or his
14 designee may represent the county board or the assessor,
15 but not both. The assessor may be represented by an
16 attorney and the board may hire a hearing officer. All
17 deliberations of the board shall be in public. The county
18 board of equalization may affirm the assessor's valuation
