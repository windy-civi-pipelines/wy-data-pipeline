incorrect claims for a period of one (1) year following
payment except where the manufacturer reasonably suspects
fraud. A manufacturer that reasonably suspects fraud may
audit claims for a period of four (4) years and charge the
dealer for fraudulent claims as otherwise provided by law.

thirty (30) days after their receipt, on forms or by
computerized communication and in the manner specified by
the manufacturer including a computerized communications
system. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing
or through electronic communication within thirty (30) days
after receipt is construed to be approved and payment shall
be made within thirty (30) days. A dealer whose claim has

processing requirement, including a clerical error or other
administrative technicality that does not question the
legitimacy of the claim, may resubmit the corrected claim
in accordance with this subsection.
(f) A new vehicle dealer may establish an hourly
labor rate or a retail parts markup rate charged for
warranty repairs to be included in the manufacturer's
schedule of compensation by mutual agreement with the

the following:
(i) The consecutive repair orders charged to
nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty service and repairs
made within one hundred eighty (180) days before the dealer

section.
(g) A new vehicle dealer shall not establish an

this section shall remain in the manufacturer's schedule of
compensation until changed in accordance with this section.

calculated by dividing the total amount charged for labor
for the qualified repair orders submitted pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section by the total number of hours
worked for the qualified repair orders.
(j) A new vehicle dealer's retail parts markup rate
shall be a percentage amount calculated by dividing the
total amount charged for the parts in the qualified repair
orders submitted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
by the total cost of the purchase of the parts, subtracting
one (1) from that amount and multiplying by one hundred
(100).
