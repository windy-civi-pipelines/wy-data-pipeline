(v) The person reporting the missing person is
unable to articulate reasonable knowledge of the missing
person or a legitimate reason for concern for the missing
person or the missing person's health, safety or welfare;
(vi) The law enforcement agency suspects, and
can articulate, that the person reported as missing
intended to lawfully flee;
(vii) The person reported missing is being
sought for reasons of harassment, stalking or retaliation;

circumstances.
(b) The primary jurisdiction for reporting a missing
person shall be the law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over the most recent verifiable location of

not determined, the primary jurisdiction shall be the law
enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the last known
residential address of the missing person. Nothing in this
subsection shall preclude or prohibit any other law
enforcement agency from accepting a report of a missing

primary jurisdiction shall request a photograph and
cellular telephone information of the missing person and,
without delay, notify appropriate law enforcement agencies
of the pertinent information and cellular telephone ping
results when appropriate.

primary jurisdiction shall evaluate the potential benefit
of notifying area news media and making an announcement via
