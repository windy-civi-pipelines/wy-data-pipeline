A BILL
for
1 AN ACT relating to children; providing legislative
2 findings; specifying protections for specified adoption and

6 conforming amendments; providing definitions; and providing
7 for an effective date.
8
9 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Wyoming:
10
11 Section 1.
12
13 (a) The legislature finds that:
14
1 HB0149

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0545
1 (i) The state seeks to place children in a safe,
2 loving and supportive home when the state is required to
3 place a child with an adoptive or foster family;
4
5 (ii) There are several adoption and foster care
6 agencies in this state that assist families with adoption
7 and foster parent placements of children;
8
9 (iii) The adoption and foster care agencies in
10 Wyoming represent diverse organizations and groups, some of
11 which are faith-based and some of which are not
12 faith-based;
13
14 (iv) Children in need of adoption and foster
15 care placement services benefit from having as many
16 adoption and foster parent agencies available as possible,
17 because the more agencies that participate in these
18 services, the greater the likelihood that children will
19 find permanent placements;
20
21 (v) The United States Supreme Court has
22 recognized the benefits of having more, not fewer, adoption
23 and foster care providers. "Maximizing the number of foster
2 HB0149

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0545
1 families and minimizing liability are important goals, but
2 the City fails to show that granting [Catholic Social
3 Services] an exception will put those goals at risk. If
4 anything, including [Catholic Social Services] in the
5 program seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number of
6 available foster parents." Fulton v. City of Philadelphia,
7 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1881–82 (2021);
8
9 (vi) Children and families benefit greatly from
10 the adoption and foster care services provided by
11 faith-based and nonfaith-based child placement agencies;
12
13 (vii) Faith-based organizations and groups have
14 a lengthy and distinguished history of providing adoption
15 and foster care services in Wyoming;
16
17 (viii) Private child placement agencies and
18 persons, including faith-based child placement agencies and
19 persons, have the right to free exercise of religion under
20 both the United States and Wyoming Constitutions. Under
21 well-settled principles of constitutional law, this right
22 includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts
23 with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs;
3 HB0149

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0545
1
2 (ix) Ensuring that faith-based child placement
3 agencies can continue to provide adoption and foster care
4 services will benefit the children and families who receive
5 those services;
6
7 (x) The United States Constitution allows all
8 adoption and foster care providers to operate according to
9 their beliefs without fear of unjust government punishment;
10
11 (xi) In a unanimous decision, the United States
12 Supreme Court made clear that state governments violate the
13 requirements of religious neutrality when they undermine
14 religious beliefs or practices, stating that government
15 "fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner
16 intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices
17 because of their religious nature." Fulton v. City of
18 Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021);
19
20 (xii) "The Constitution forbids laws that
21 prohibit the free exercise of religion. That guarantee
22 protects not just the right to be a religious person,
23 holding beliefs inwardly and secretly; it also protects the
4 HB0149

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0545
1 right to act on those beliefs outwardly and publicly."
2 Espinoza v. Mont. Dep't of Revenue, 591 U.S. 464, 510
3 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (emphases in original);
4
5 (xiii) The United States Supreme Court has "long
6 recognized the importance of protecting religious actions,
7 not just religious status." Espinoza, 591 U.S. at 511
8 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). The "First Amendment protects
9 the 'freedom to act' as well as the 'freedom to believe.'"
10 Espinoza, 591 U.S. at 511 (Gorsuch, J., concurring)
11 (quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303
12 (1940));
13
14 (xiv) The government violates the Free Exercise
15 Clause whenever it "conditions receipt of an important
16 benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or
17 where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated
18 by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure
19 on an adherent to modify his behavior to violate his
20 beliefs." Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Sec.
21 Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717–18 (1981).
