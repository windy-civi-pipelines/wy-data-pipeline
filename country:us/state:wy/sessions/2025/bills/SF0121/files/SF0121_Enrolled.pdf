31-2-212. Loss, mutilation or destruction of
registration, plates or validation stickers.
Upon loss, mutilation or destruction of a certificate of
registration, license plate, or validation sticker the
owner of a vehicle may obtain a duplicate certificate of
registration, new license plates or validation stickers
from any county treasurer or the department if the vehicle
was registered or plates or stickers were issued by the
department upon application showing the loss, mutilation or
destruction, return of mutilated plates or stickers and
payment of the duplicate registration, plate or sticker
fee. For those vehicles registered under the provisions of
W.S. 31-2-213(h), 31-2-215 through 31-2-223, 31-2-226,
31-2-227 or 31-2-229 through 31-2-233 31-2-234 replacement
duplicate license plates may be obtained upon application

were purchased or the department if applicable, accompanied
by fees as provided by W.S. 31-3-102(a)(vi)(C). Duplicate
license plates obtained under this section to replace lost
or stolen plates shall not be displayed on the vehicle
until the validation stickers on the lost or stolen plates
have expired. Upon loss, mutilation or destruction of a
dealer plate or validation sticker the dealer may obtain a
replacement dealer plate or validation sticker from the
county treasurer from which he purchased the original plate
in the same manner as the owner of a vehicle and upon
payment of the appropriate fee under W.S. 31-3-102(a)(vi).
Obtaining a replacement plate is not the purchase of an
additional plate under W.S. 31-16-125(b)(i). Upon
application for new license plates or stickers the county
treasurer shall notify the department and the county
sheriff as soon as possible of the loss, mutilation or
