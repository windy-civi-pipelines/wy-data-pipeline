5
6 (i) The electric utility failed to substantially
7 comply with an approved wildfire mitigation plan, and that
8 failure was the actual and proximate cause of the damages
9 to the plaintiff. For purposes of this paragraph, an
10 electric utility shall be deemed to have substantially
11 complied with the wildfire mitigation plan if the electric
12 utility attempted in good faith to comply with the plan but
13 was denied or unreasonably delayed access to a right-of-way
14 after the electric utility requested access to the
15 right-of-way to perform vegetation management or fire
16 mitigation work in accordance with the plan;
17
18 (ii) The electric utility acted with malice or
19 criminal intent, and the electric utility's action was the

11
12 (iii) No plaintiff shall recover noneconomic
13 losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or died

18 entitled to raise in a civil action for damages caused by
19 wildfire.
