11
12 9-4-227. Income tax prevention account.
13
14 (a) There is created the income tax prevention account. The
15 account shall consist of all funds transferred or appropriated to
16 the account by law. All monies deposited or transferred into the
17 account are inviolate and constitute a permanent or perpetual trust
18 fund, subject to the provisions for the withdrawal of funds
19 provided by this section.
20
21 (b) The state treasurer shall invest all funds within the
22 income tax prevention account in accordance with W.S. 9-4-715(a)
23 and (c) through (e) and 9-4-716. W.S. 9-4-716(e) shall not apply
24 to the account. The state treasurer, or the treasurer's designee,
25 which shall be registered under the federal Investment Advisor's
26 Act of 1940, as amended and if required to be registered by the
27 terms of that act, may invest the unobligated, unencumbered balance
28 of the account in equities, including stocks of corporations. The
29 account shall be invested so that the overall risk profile of the
30 account's investments shall not materially exceed the risk profile
31 of a reference portfolio that consists of eighty-five percent (85%)
32 private equity and fifteen percent (15%) private credit
33 investments. In adopting investment policy statements for the
34 account, the board shall seek to preserve the balance of the
35 account in a manner that strives for the highest possible
36 risk-adjusted total net return consistent with an appropriate
37 level of safety and liquidity, giving consideration to the
38 account's potential extended investment period and the extended
39 period during which monies in the account may be ineligible for
40 withdrawal.
41
42 (c) Beginning on July 1, 2025 and on each July 1 thereafter,
43 the state auditor shall transfer one hundred million dollars
44 ($100,000,000.00), or as much thereof as is available, from the
1

1 legislative stabilization reserve account to the income tax
2 prevention account. The transfer under this subsection shall occur
3 after all other transfers and appropriations from the legislative
4 stabilization reserve account required by law are made.
5
6 (d) Transfers made under subsection (c) of this section, and
7 the investment of those transfers, shall be in accordance with all
8 of the following:
9
10 (i) The state treasurer shall separately account for each
11 annual transfer made under subsection (c) of this section and shall
12 separately account for all earnings from each annual transfer;
13
14 (ii) Annual transfers shall not be withdrawn from the
15 account;
16
17 (iii) Investment earnings from each annual transfer shall
18 not be withdrawn except in accordance with subsection (e) of this
19 section.
20
21 (e) On July 1 of each fiscal year after fourteen (14) fiscal
22 years have elapsed, all investment earnings in the income tax
23 prevention account arising from the annual transfer to the account
24 made fourteen (14) fiscal years earlier shall be deposited in the
25 general fund. For purposes of this subsection:
26
27 (i) "Investment earnings" mean all interest income,
28 dividends, realized capital gains and returned capital;
29
30 (ii) Investment earnings shall be distributed under this
31 subsection as the earnings are received or when the fund from which
32 earnings are derived matures;
33
34 (iii) The state treasurer may liquidate or sell investments
35 in order to maximize earnings or minimize costs associated with
36 making the deposit required under this subsection.
37
38 (f) Not later than October 1 of each year, the state
39 treasurer shall report to the joint appropriations committee and
40 the select committee on capital financing and investments
41 regarding the investment of funds in the income tax prevention
42 account. The report shall include information on the annual review
43 of the account's investment policy statement and an estimate of
44 investment earnings available for deposit to the general fund for
45 the immediately succeeding fiscal year.".

17 invested in stock of a corporation or other equities, the overall
18 risk profile of the investments, excluding any specific public
19 purpose investment authorized or directed by the
20 legislature, shall not materially exceed the risk profile of a
21 reference portfolio that consists of seventy percent (70%) global
22 equities and thirty percent (30%) domestic fixed income
23 investments. The state treasurer after consultation with the
24 investment funds committee shall submit to the board the
25 committee's recommendations of specific benchmarks for the
26 measurement of the portfolio risk characteristics. The specific
27 benchmarks shall be determined by the board. Any provision of law
28 which restricts or expands the investment of a specific fund or
29 account to a greater degree than the provisions of this subsection
30 shall control over this subsection.".
