11
12 9-4-227. Income tax prevention account.
13
14 (a) There is created the income tax prevention account. The
15 account shall consist of all funds transferred or appropriated to
16 the account by law. All monies deposited or transferred into the
17 account are inviolate and constitute a permanent or perpetual trust
18 fund, subject to the provisions for the withdrawal of funds
19 provided by this section.
20
21 (b) The state treasurer shall invest all funds within the
22 income tax prevention account in accordance with W.S. 9-4-715(a)
23 and (c) through (e) and 9-4-716. W.S. 9-4-716(e) shall not apply
24 to the account. The state treasurer, or the treasurer's designee,
25 which shall be registered under the federal Investment Advisor's
26 Act of 1940, as amended and if required to be registered by the
27 terms of that act, may invest the unobligated, unencumbered balance
28 of the account in equities, including stocks of corporations. The
29 account shall be invested so that the overall risk profile of the
30 account's investments shall not materially exceed the risk profile
31 of a reference portfolio that consists of eighty-five percent (85%)
32 private equity and fifteen percent (15%) private credit
33 investments. In adopting investment policy statements for the
34 account, the board shall seek to preserve the balance of the
35 account in a manner that strives for the highest possible
36 risk-adjusted total net return consistent with an appropriate
37 level of safety and liquidity, giving consideration to the
38 account's potential extended investment period and the extended
39 period during which monies in the account may be ineligible for
40 withdrawal.
41
42 (c) On July 1, 2025, if there is not less than two billion
43 dollars ($2,000,000,000.00) in the legislative stabilization
44 reserve account on that date, the state auditor shall transfer one
1
1 hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) from the legislative
2 stabilization reserve account to the income tax prevention
3 account. The transfer under this subsection shall occur after all
4 other transfers and appropriations from the legislative
5 stabilization reserve account required by law are made. Additional
6 transfers to the income tax prevention account in future years
7 shall be subject to legislative appropriation.
8
9 (d) Transfers made under subsection (c) of this section, and
10 the investment of those transfers, shall be in accordance with all
11 of the following:
12
13 (i) The state treasurer shall separately account for
14 each transfer made under subsection (c) of this section and shall
15 separately account for all earnings from each transfer;
16
17 (ii) Transfers shall not be withdrawn from the account;
18
19 (iii) Investment earnings from each transfer shall not
20 be withdrawn except in accordance with subsection (e) of this
21 section.
22
23 (e) On July 1 of each fiscal year after fourteen (14) fiscal
24 years have elapsed, all investment earnings in the income tax
25 prevention account arising from the transfer to the account made
26 fourteen (14) fiscal years earlier shall be deposited in the
27 general fund. For purposes of this subsection:
28
29 (i) "Investment earnings" mean all interest income,
30 dividends, realized capital gains and returned capital;
31
32 (ii) Investment earnings shall be distributed under
33 this subsection as the earnings are received or when the fund from
34 which earnings are derived matures;
35
36 (iii) The state treasurer may liquidate or sell
37 investments in order to maximize earnings or minimize costs
38 associated with making the deposit required under this subsection.
39
40 (f) Not later than October 1 of each year, the state
41 treasurer shall report to the joint appropriations committee and
42 the select committee on capital financing and investments
43 regarding the investment of funds in the income tax prevention
44 account. The report shall include information on the annual review
45 of the account's investment policy statement and an estimate of
46 investment earnings available for deposit to the general fund for
47 the immediately succeeding fiscal year.".

25 investments. The state treasurer after consultation with the
26 investment funds committee shall submit to the board the
