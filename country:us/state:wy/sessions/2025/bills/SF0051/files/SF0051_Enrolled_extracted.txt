(c) The commission shall administer the monies in the
universal service fund to assist only those customers of
telecommunications companies located in areas of this state
with relatively high rates for noncompetitive essential
local exchange services. Services deemed competitive under
W.S. 37-15-202(a), (c) or (d) shall not be eligible for
universal service fund support under this article. The
commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall
determine a reasonable amount and a fair method of
distributing monies. The commission may authorize a credit
to customer bills, in the amount specified by the
commission, to reflect distributions received by the local
exchange company from the universal service fund, provided
that the credit is given only to one (1) line for each
customer or household. The commission shall ensure that
the method shall promote the emergence of competition in
providing local exchange service.
(d) In accordance with the method of distribution
determined by the commission, a telecommunications company
shall, unless it elects to receive Wyoming universal
service funds pursuant to the method set forth in
subsection (g) of this section, receive funds under this

Section 5:
section to the extent that its noncompetitive essential
local exchange service prices, after consideration of any
contributions from the federal universal service fund,
exceed the price benchmark established in subsection (h) of
this section.
(g) A telecommunications company that undertakes the
requirements set forth in this subsection may make a
one-time, irrevocable before July 1, 2023, election in
writing to the commission to receive Wyoming universal
service funds pursuant to this subsection rather than
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. In order to
13

SIXTY-EIGHTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING
2025 GENERAL SESSION
receive funds pursuant to this subsection, the company
shall provide essential noncompetitive local exchange
service, or its functional equivalent, upon reasonable
request throughout the local exchange area of a rural
incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by the federal
communications commission on January 1, 2015, at a price
not exceeding the price benchmark established in subsection
(h) of this section. A telecommunications company which
elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant
to this subsection shall receive funds to the extent that
its loop costs, as reflected in the company's most recent
annual filing of unseparated loop costs filed with the
Universal Service Administration Company, exceed the
company's most recent annual federal universal service
funds receipts and annual local revenues. In calculating
annual local revenues the commission shall utilize the
imputed price benchmark established in subsection (h) of
this section. If an otherwise qualified company elects to
receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this
subsection, but does not file an annual unseparated loop
cost report with the Universal Service Administration
Company, it shall file the equivalent information with the
commission.
(h) The price benchmark shall be thirty dollars
($30.00) thirty‑five dollars ($35.00) unless otherwise
adjusted by the commission pursuant to this subsection.
The commission shall review the price benchmark one (1)
time every four (4) years and, after review, shall adjust
the benchmark as necessary to assure that it approximates
one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide
average essential local exchange service price. The
commission may change the price benchmark at any time if,
after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission
determines that the price benchmark does not approximate

one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide
average essential local exchange service price and that the
price benchmark should be adjusted by ten percent (10%) or
more.
37-15-502. Universal service fund eligibility and
distribution to carriers.
(a) Telecommunications companies which use cellular,
radio spectrum or other wireless technology to provide
supported essential services to customers who are otherwise
eligible to receive universal service support pursuant to
W.S. 37-15-501, may establish eligibility to receive
universal service fund distributions in an amount to be
determined by the commission, provided that:
(i) The telecommunications company will offer
and advertise all services supported by the universal
service fund supported services throughout the entire local
exchange area;
(iii) The telecommunications company's bill to
the customer reflects a credit for the amount of
distribution the company receives from the state universal
service fund for providing services supported by the
universal service fund supported services to that customer;
and

Section 6:

(c) The commission shall administer the monies in the
universal service fund to assist only those customers of
telecommunications companies located in areas of this state
with relatively high rates for noncompetitive essential
local exchange services. Services deemed competitive under
W.S. 37-15-202(a), (c) or (d) shall not be eligible for
universal service fund support under this article. The
commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall
determine a reasonable amount and a fair method of
distributing monies. The commission may authorize a credit
to customer bills, in the amount specified by the
commission, to reflect distributions received by the local
exchange company from the universal service fund, provided
that the credit is given only to one (1) line for each
customer or household. The commission shall ensure that
the method shall promote the emergence of competition in
providing local exchange service.
(d) In accordance with the method of distribution
determined by the commission, a telecommunications company
shall, unless it elects to receive Wyoming universal
service funds pursuant to the method set forth in
subsection (g) of this section, receive funds under this
section to the extent that its noncompetitive essential
local exchange service prices, after consideration of any
contributions from the federal universal service fund,
exceed the price benchmark established in subsection (h) of
this section.
(g) A telecommunications company that undertakes the
requirements set forth in this subsection may make a
one-time, irrevocable before July 1, 2023, election in
writing to the commission to receive Wyoming universal
service funds pursuant to this subsection rather than
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. In order to
13

ORIGINAL SENATE ENGROSSED
FILE NO. SF0051
ENROLLED ACT NO. 70, SENATE
SIXTY-EIGHTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING
2025 GENERAL SESSION
receive funds pursuant to this subsection, the company
shall provide essential noncompetitive local exchange
service, or its functional equivalent, upon reasonable
request throughout the local exchange area of a rural
incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by the federal
communications commission on January 1, 2015, at a price
not exceeding the price benchmark established in subsection
(h) of this section. A telecommunications company which
elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant
to this subsection shall receive funds to the extent that
its loop costs, as reflected in the company's most recent
annual filing of unseparated loop costs filed with the
Universal Service Administration Company, exceed the
company's most recent annual federal universal service
funds receipts and annual local revenues. In calculating
annual local revenues the commission shall utilize the
imputed price benchmark established in subsection (h) of
this section. If an otherwise qualified company elects to
receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this
subsection, but does not file an annual unseparated loop
cost report with the Universal Service Administration
Company, it shall file the equivalent information with the
commission.
(h) The price benchmark shall be thirty dollars
($30.00) thirty‑five dollars ($35.00) unless otherwise
adjusted by the commission pursuant to this subsection.
The commission shall review the price benchmark one (1)
time every four (4) years and, after review, shall adjust
the benchmark as necessary to assure that it approximates
one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide
average essential local exchange service price. The
commission may change the price benchmark at any time if,
after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission
determines that the price benchmark does not approximate

average essential local exchange service price and that the
price benchmark should be adjusted by ten percent (10%) or
more.
37-15-502. Universal service fund eligibility and
distribution to carriers.
(a) Telecommunications companies which use cellular,
radio spectrum or other wireless technology to provide
supported essential services to customers who are otherwise
eligible to receive universal service support pursuant to
W.S. 37-15-501, may establish eligibility to receive
universal service fund distributions in an amount to be
determined by the commission, provided that:
(i) The telecommunications company will offer
and advertise all services supported by the universal
service fund supported services throughout the entire local
exchange area;
(iii) The telecommunications company's bill to
the customer reflects a credit for the amount of
distribution the company receives from the state universal
service fund for providing services supported by the
universal service fund supported services to that customer;
and
Section 2. W.S. 37-15-103(a)(iv)(A) through (D) and
(xvi) and 37-15-104(a)(i) through (xiii) are repealed.
