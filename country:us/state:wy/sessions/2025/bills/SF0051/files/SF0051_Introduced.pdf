2 assure that it approximates one hundred thirty percent
3 (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local
4 exchange service price. The commission may change the price
5 benchmark at any time if, after notice and opportunity for
6 a hearing, the commission determines that the price
7 benchmark does not approximate one hundred thirty percent
8 (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local
9 exchange service price and that the price benchmark should
10 be adjusted by ten percent (10%) or more.

16 the next calendar quarter;
17
18 (iii) A seller shall collect the charge from
19 each purchaser of prepaid wireless communications access,
