13 director which shall be submitted to and reviewed by the
14 director, governor and the management council. The public
15 shall be afforded a thirty (30) day public comment
16 opportunity to review the feasibility agreement prior to
17 its submission to the governor and the management council.
18 The purposes of this feasibility agreement and study are to
19 allow the state to make a preliminary determination,
20 whether, on the basis of the feasibility agreement and
21 study, the proposed benefits substantially outweigh any
22 adverse effects and to allow an applicant based on the
23 state's preliminary review of any proposed benefit to
11 HB0016
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0253
1 determine whether or not a prudent investor, planner,

11 be used by the department for costs attendant to the
12 preliminary agreement. Excess funds collected may be used
13 by the department to review an application submitted under
14 W.S. 35-11-1502. Appropriate time shall be afforded the
15 director, the governor, the management council and the
16 applicant to prepare and to evaluate the preliminary
17 agreement and study, but neither the state nor the

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0253
1 including the annual acceptance taxes to be levied, on fuel
2 rods, based upon the weight, in kilograms, of fuel rods the
3 high-level radioactive waste stored at the Wyoming

11
12 (ii) "High-level radioactive waste storage"
13 means the emplacement of high-level radioactive waste, or
14 spent nuclear fuel regardless of the intent to recover that
15 waste or fuel for subsequent use, processing or disposal;
16
17 (iii) "High-level radioactive waste storage
18 facility" includes any facility for high-level radioactive
19 waste storage, other than a permanent repository operated
20 by a federal agency pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy

11 storage installation may enter into a preliminary but
12 nonbinding feasibility agreement and study with the
13 director which shall be submitted to and reviewed by the
14 director, governor and the management council. The public
15 shall be afforded a thirty (30) day public comment
16 opportunity to review the feasibility agreement prior to
17 its submission to the governor and the management council.
18 The purposes of this feasibility agreement and study are to
19 allow the state to make a preliminary determination,
20 whether, on the basis of the feasibility agreement and
21 study, the proposed benefits substantially outweigh any
22 adverse effects and to allow an applicant based on the
23 state's preliminary review of any proposed benefit to
11 HB0016

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0253
1 determine whether or not a prudent investor, planner,

3 application. Upon entering into a feasibility agreement,
4 the applicant shall pay to the state a fee of eighty
5 thousand dollars ($80,000.00). Effective July 1, 2018, and
6 annually thereafter, the fee shall be adjusted for
7 inflation by the department using the consumer price index
8 or its successor index of the United States department of
9 labor, bureau of labor statistics, for the calendar year
10 immediately preceding the date of adjustment. The fee shall
11 be used by the department for costs attendant to the
12 preliminary agreement. Excess funds collected may be used
13 by the department to review an application submitted under
14 W.S. 35-11-1502. Appropriate time shall be afforded the
15 director, the governor, the management council and the

19 agreement and study. The preliminary feasibility agreement
