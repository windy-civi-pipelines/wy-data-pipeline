18 "Section 2.
19
20 (a) The legislature finds that:
21
22 (i) Wyoming and the nation's voluntary livestock
23 identification system has served the livestock industry well for
24 decades;
25
26 (ii) The United States department of agriculture's
27 animal and plant health inspection service announced a final rule
28 in April of 2024 that would require certain livestock to wear
29 electronically readable devices in order to prevent and manage
30 livestock disease outbreaks;
31
32 (iii) If the United States department of agriculture
33 and the animal and plant health inspection service were concerned
34 with and focused on preventing a livestock disease outbreak, they
35 would stop the importation of livestock from countries that have
36 known and documented problems with disease, yet they do not do so;
37
38 (iv) The vast majority of livestock affected by this
39 mandatory electronic identification rule originate from wide open
40 spaces and live on clean, disease-free pastures and not in confined
41 areas with thousands of livestock coming from different areas;
42
1

1 (v) The United States department of agriculture and the
2 animal and plant health inspection service have stated that a
3 seventy percent (70%) compliance rate with mandatory electronic
4 identification usage would be necessary to make the identification
5 program an effective disease traceability requirement;
6
7 (vi) Wyoming already has livestock identification
8 methods that are far superior to the mandatory electronic
9 identification rules that, according to the United States
10 department of agriculture and the animal and plant health
11 inspection service, are specifically targeted to apply to only
12 eleven percent (11%) of all livestock in the country; and
13
14 (vii) The mandatory electronic identification rule was
15 put in place by a federal government agency rather than being voted
16 on by the United States congress, making it only a rule and not
17 codified law.
18
19 (b) It is the policy of the state of Wyoming that:
20
21 (i) Wyoming is opposed to the animal and plant health
22 inspection service's rule mandating electronic identification
23 devices for Wyoming livestock;
24
25 (ii) W.S. 11-18-117 clearly defines the terms by which
26 the Wyoming livestock industry can continue to do business and
27 have the freedom, right and liberty to use historically reliable,
28 affordable, confidential and voluntary methods of livestock
29 identification, including brands, backtags, tattoos and ear tags;
30
31 (iii) Wyoming will seek to work with existing metal
32 identification tag manufacturers to produce those tags
33 historically used to confirm livestock health and identity;
34
35 (iv) Wyoming is committed to working with other states
36 to develop agreements and arrangements to allow livestock to be
37 transported to and from Wyoming without being required to use
38 electronic identification ear tags;
39
40 (v) Wyoming shall demand that the United States
41 department of agriculture and the animal and plant health
42 inspection service provide a complete and full accounting and
43 accurate estimate of all costs associated with mandating that
44 Wyoming's livestock producers use electronic identification ear
45 tags, including costs associated with hardware, software, ear
46 tags, wands, retrofitting of livestock handling facilities,
47 retrofitting of sales barns, working of livestock and costs related
2

1 to additional paperwork, digital input and filings necessary to
2 prove compliance with the electronic identification ear tag rule
3 to the Wyoming legislature.".
