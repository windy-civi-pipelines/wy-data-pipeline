(i) Wyoming and the nation's voluntary livestock

well for decades;

in order to prevent and manage livestock disease outbreaks;
(iii) If the United States department of

problems with disease, yet they do not do so;
(iv) The vast majority of livestock affected by
this mandatory electronic identification rule originate
from wide open spaces and live on clean, disease-free
pastures and not in confined areas with thousands of
livestock coming from different areas;

(i) Wyoming is opposed to the animal and plant
health inspection service's rule mandating electronic
identification devices for Wyoming livestock;

which the Wyoming livestock industry can continue to do
business and have the freedom, right and liberty to use
historically reliable, affordable, confidential and
voluntary methods of livestock identification, including
brands, backtags, tattoos and ear tags;
(iii) Wyoming will seek to work with existing
metal identification tag manufacturers to produce those
tags historically used to confirm livestock health and
identity;
(iv) Wyoming is committed to working with other
states to develop agreements and arrangements to allow
livestock to be transported to and from Wyoming without
being required to use electronic identification ear tags;

department of agriculture and the animal and plant health
inspection service provide a complete and full accounting
