1 SF0064

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0515
1
2 (a) The legislature finds that:
3
4 (i) Wyoming and the nation's voluntary livestock
5 identification system has served the livestock industry
6 well for decades;
7
8 (ii) The United States department of
9 agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service
10 announced a final rule in April of 2024 that would require
11 certain livestock to wear electronically readable devices
12 in order to prevent and manage livestock disease outbreaks;
13
14 (iii) If the United States department of
15 agriculture and the animal and plant health inspection
16 service were concerned with and focused on preventing a
17 livestock disease outbreak, they would stop the importation
18 of livestock from countries that have known and documented
19 problems with disease, yet they do not do so;
20
21 (iv) The vast majority of livestock affected by
22 this mandatory electronic identification rule originate
23 from wide open spaces and live on clean, disease-free
2 SF0064

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0515
1 pastures and not in confined areas with thousands of
2 livestock coming from different areas;
3
4 (v) The United States department of agriculture
5 and the animal and plant health inspection service have
6 stated that a seventy percent (70%) compliance rate with
7 mandatory electronic identification usage would be
8 necessary to make the identification program an effective
9 disease traceability requirement;
10
11 (vi) Wyoming already has livestock
12 identification methods that are far superior to the
13 mandatory electronic identification rules that, according
14 to the United States department of agriculture and the
15 animal and plant health inspection service, are
16 specifically targeted to apply to only eleven percent (11%)
17 of all livestock in the country; and
18
19 (vii) The mandatory electronic identification
20 rule was put in place by a federal government agency rather
21 than being voted on by the United States congress, making
22 it only a rule and not codified law.
23
3 SF0064

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0515
1 (b) It is the policy of the state of Wyoming that:
2
3 (i) Wyoming is opposed to the animal and plant
4 health inspection service's rule mandating electronic
5 identification devices for Wyoming livestock;
6
7 (ii) W.S. 11-18-117 clearly defines the terms by
8 which the Wyoming livestock industry can continue to do
9 business and have the freedom, right and liberty to use
10 historically reliable, affordable, confidential and
11 voluntary methods of livestock identification, including
12 brands, backtags, tattoos and ear tags;
13
14 (iii) Wyoming will seek to work with existing
15 metal identification tag manufacturers to produce those
16 tags historically used to confirm livestock health and
17 identity;
18
19 (iv) Wyoming is committed to working with other
20 states to develop agreements and arrangements to allow
21 livestock to be transported to and from Wyoming without
22 being required to use electronic identification ear tags;
23
4 SF0064

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0515
1 (v) Wyoming shall demand that the United States
2 department of agriculture and the animal and plant health
3 inspection service provide a complete and full accounting
4 and accurate estimate of all costs associated with
5 mandating that Wyoming's livestock producers use electronic
6 identification ear tags, including costs associated with
7 hardware, software, ear tags, wands, retrofitting of
8 livestock handling facilities, retrofitting of sales barns,
9 working of livestock and costs related to additional
10 paperwork, digital input and filings necessary to prove
11 compliance with the electronic identification ear tag rule
12 to the Wyoming legislature.
13
14 (c) The state veterinarian and local veterinarians
15 shall inform livestock producers of all available options
16 under W.S. 11-18-117 for identification regarding disease
17 traceability.
18
19 (d) The buyers of livestock in receiving states shall
20 be responsible for tagging livestock if an electronic
21 identification device requirement is mandated in the
22 receiving state, unless the Wyoming livestock owner has
23 voluntarily utilized electronic identification devices.
