13 (b) There is created the permanent Wyoming mineral trust
14 fund reserve account. All funds within the account shall be
15 invested by the state treasurer as authorized under W.S. 9-4-
16 715(a), (d), (e) and (r) and all investment earnings from the
17 account shall be credited to the account. Except for funds
18 specified by the legislature that guarantee the obligations of
19 permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund investment earnings and funds
20 to be transferred into the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund,
21 funds deposited into the reserve account created by this subsection
22 are intended to be inviolate and constitute a permanent or

24 and each fiscal year thereafter, to the extent funds are available,
25 the state treasurer shall transfer unobligated funds from this
26 account to the general fund on a quarterly, pro-rata basis as

28 percent (2.5%) of the previous five (5) year average market value
29 of the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, calculated on the
30 first day of the fiscal year, is available for expenditure during
31 each fiscal year. As soon as possible after the end of each of the
32 fiscal years beginning on and after July 1, 2017, after making any

34 subsection, revenues in this account in excess of two hundred
35 forty-five percent (245%) of the spending policy amount in
36 subsection (d) of this section shall be credited to the permanent

38 fiscal year thereafter:

40 (iii) As soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal
41 year, after making any other transfers provided by law from the

43 calculating the balance of the account under this subsection, the
44 state treasurer shall transfer from the account an amount equal to
1
