2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0426
1 the amount by which each district's operating balance and
2 cash reserves at the end of the preceding fiscal year
3 exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total foundation
4 program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309 for the
5 preceding fiscal year. In making this calculation, the
6 entire operating balance and cash reserves for each
7 district for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, as
8 computed by the department, shall be separately accounted
9 for and excluded, until it has been completely expended by
10 the district. Revenues from settlements of protested
11 amounts attributable to levies assessed under W.S.
12 21-13-102(a)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) and 21-13-201, regardless of

18 treasurer. Except as otherwise provided in 1997 Special
19 Session Laws, chapter 3, section 306(e), as amended, and
20 except as excluded under this subsection, that excess shall
21 be deemed to be a state revenue under W.S. 21-13-310(a) for
22 the purpose of determining distributions under W.S.

1 The department shall promulgate rules, including reporting
2 requirements and procedures for districts, to implement
3 this subsection. As used in this section, "operating
4 balance and cash reserves" means those financial resources
5 of the district which are not encumbered by the district
6 board of trustees for expenditure to meet an existing legal
7 obligation or otherwise restricted by law or regulation for
8 expenditure on specific educational programs. For purposes
9 of this subsection, any balance within a district's
10 separate account established under W.S. 21-15-109(e) for
11 major building and facility repair and replacement shall be
12 deemed restricted by law for expenditure as provided by
13 W.S. 21-15-109(e) and shall not be considered an operating
14 balance and cash reserve under this section. For the fiscal
15 year ending June 30, 2022 through the fiscal year ending
16 June 30, 2026 June 30, 2028, the department shall compute
17 the amount by which each district's operating balance and
18 cash reserves at the end of the preceding fiscal year
19 exceed thirty percent (30%) of the total foundation program
20 amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309 for the preceding
21 fiscal year. During this period, the amount of a district's
22 operating balance and cash reserves that may be increased

1 total foundation program amount computed under W.S.
2 21-13-309 for the preceding fiscal year shall be accounted
3 for and reported separately and shall not be transferred or
4 expended for purposes of capital construction. For purposes
