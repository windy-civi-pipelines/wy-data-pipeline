18 market value of residential real property shall be
19 determined as follows:
20
21 (I) For any residential real property
22 that was last acquired on or before December 31, 2019, the
23 base year value for the residential real property shall be
14 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 equal to the fair market value of the property on January
2 1, 2019;
3
4 (II) For any residential real property
5 that was last acquired on or after January 1, 2020 and on
6 or before December 31, 2025, the base year value for the
7 residential real property shall be equal to the fair market
8 value of the property on January 1 of the year the property
9 was last acquired;
10
11 (III) For any residential real
12 property that was acquired on or after January 1, 2026,
13 there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
14 acquisition value of the property is the fair market value
15 of the property and the acquisition value shall be used as
16 the base year value for the property except as provided in
17 subdivision (IV) of this subparagraph;
18
19 (IV) Notwithstanding subdivision (III)
20 of this subparagraph, for any residential real property
21 that was acquired on or after January 1, 2026, the fair
22 market value of the property on January 1 of the year the
15 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 property was acquired shall be used as the base year value
2 of the property if:
3
4 (1) The presumption under
5 subdivision (III) of this subparagraph is rebutted by a
6 preponderance of the evidence showing that the acquisition
7 price paid to acquire the property was not fair market
8 value because a party to the transaction was acting under
9 undue influence or the terms of the transaction were not
10 negotiated at arms-length between an informed buyer and
11 seller; or
12
13 (2) The owner of the residential
14 real property does not submit information that is
15 sufficient to establish the acquisition value of the
16 residential real property under subdivision (III) of this
17 subparagraph. The department shall promulgate rules
18 regarding the documentation and procedures required to
19 establish acquisition value under this paragraph.
20
21 (B) The base year value determined under
22 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be adjusted as
23 follows:
16 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1
2 (I) The base year value shall be
3 adjusted by an inflation factor that compounds annually
4 each year beginning in the first year after the base year
5 value is determined under subparagraph (A) of this
6 paragraph. The inflation factor shall be the lesser of two
7 percent (2%) or the rate of the consumer price index or its
8 successor index of the United States department of labor,
9 bureau of labor statistics, for the applicable year;
10
11 (II) The base year value shall be
12 adjusted as necessary to account for increases in the value
13 of the property caused by new construction or significant
14 additions to the residential real property. The value of
15 the new construction or significant additions shall be
16 added to the base year value of the residential real
17 property. The value of the new construction or significant
18 additions shall be determined by the construction costs.
19 The department shall adopt rules specifying how
20 construction costs are determined. Actual costs may be
21 submitted to determine construction costs. If actual costs
22 are not submitted or if the construction costs do not
23 represent fair value because a party to the transaction was
17 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 acting under undue influence or the terms of the
2 transaction were not negotiated at arms-length, the
3 construction costs shall be determined based on average
4 construction costs in the state for the applicable tax
5 year. The department shall adopt rules specifying how
6 significant additions to residential real property and
7 construction costs are reported. As used in this
8 subdivision, "significant addition" means any construction
9 of real property that adds habitable square feet to the
10 residential real property and includes construction where
11 all or a portion of the residential real property is
12 demolished and reconstructed. "Significant addition" shall
13 not include finishing an unfinished portion of the existing
14 residential real property.
15
16 (C) The amount determined pursuant to
17 subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall be the
18 fair market value of the residential real property until
19 ownership of the property is transferred to a new person.
20 Each time residential real property is transferred to a new
21 person, the property shall be valued as provided in
22 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to determine the new
23 base year value of the property. The new base year value of
18 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 the property shall be subject to the inflation factor
2 provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in
3 subsequent tax years;
4
5 (D) As used in this paragraph:
6
7 (I) "Acquisition value," as used in
8 this subparagraph, means the actual full amount paid or to
9 be paid to acquire residential real property;
10
11 (II) "Residential real property" means
12 real property improved by a dwelling designed to house not
13 more than four (4) families and includes a detached garage
14 owned by the owner of the dwelling and any associated
15 residential land up to thirty-five (35) acres where the
16 dwelling is located if the land is owned by the owner of
17 the dwelling. The dwelling may include any type of
18 residence including a single family home, an individual
19 condominium unit, a mobile home or a trailer if the
20 dwelling is used as a primary residence;
21
22 (III) "Transfer" or "acquisition" of
23 residential real property does not include:
19 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1
2 (1) A transfer of property
3 between spouses or between a parent and their child;

5 (2) A transfer of property
6 pursuant to a court order including to effectuate a
7 settlement agreement or in compliance with a decree of
8 divorce or judicial separation;
9
10 (3) A transfer of property to a
11 trust established for the benefit of the prior owner;
12
13 (4) A transfer of property to a
14 corporation, partnership or limited liability company if
15 the prior owner of the property is a shareholder or owner
16 of the corporation, partnership or limited liability
17 company;
18
19 (5) A donation of residential
20 real property to a religious or charitable organization
21 including a nonprofit organization;
22
20 HB0282
2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 (6) Any other transfer of
2 property that the department determines by rule should not
3 be an acquisition of property due to the relationship of
4 the parties or other factors.

15 is incorrect. For purposes of this paragraph, if a
16 statement of reasons is mailed or sent by electronic

5 that was last acquired on or after January 1, 2020 and on
6 or before December 31, 2025, the base year value for the
7 residential real property shall be equal to the fair market
8 value of the property on January 1 of the year the property
9 was last acquired;
10
11 (III) For any residential real
12 property that was acquired on or after January 1, 2026,
13 there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
14 acquisition value of the property is the fair market value
15 of the property and the acquisition value shall be used as
16 the base year value for the property except as provided in
17 subdivision (IV) of this subparagraph;
18
19 (IV) Notwithstanding subdivision (III)
20 of this subparagraph, for any residential real property
21 that was acquired on or after January 1, 2026, the fair
22 market value of the property on January 1 of the year the
15 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 property was acquired shall be used as the base year value
2 of the property if:
3
4 (1) The presumption under
5 subdivision (III) of this subparagraph is rebutted by a
6 preponderance of the evidence showing that the acquisition
7 price paid to acquire the property was not fair market
8 value because a party to the transaction was acting under
9 undue influence or the terms of the transaction were not
10 negotiated at arms-length between an informed buyer and
11 seller; or
12
13 (2) The owner of the residential
14 real property does not submit information that is
15 sufficient to establish the acquisition value of the
16 residential real property under subdivision (III) of this
17 subparagraph. The department shall promulgate rules
18 regarding the documentation and procedures required to
19 establish acquisition value under this paragraph.
20
21 (B) The base year value determined under
22 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be adjusted as
23 follows:
16 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1
2 (I) The base year value shall be
3 adjusted by an inflation factor that compounds annually
4 each year beginning in the first year after the base year
5 value is determined under subparagraph (A) of this
6 paragraph. The inflation factor shall be the lesser of two
7 percent (2%) or the rate of the consumer price index or its
8 successor index of the United States department of labor,
9 bureau of labor statistics, for the applicable year;
10
11 (II) The base year value shall be
12 adjusted as necessary to account for increases in the value
13 of the property caused by new construction or significant
14 additions to the residential real property. The value of
15 the new construction or significant additions shall be
16 added to the base year value of the residential real
17 property. The value of the new construction or significant
18 additions shall be determined by the construction costs.
19 The department shall adopt rules specifying how
20 construction costs are determined. Actual costs may be
21 submitted to determine construction costs. If actual costs
22 are not submitted or if the construction costs do not
23 represent fair value because a party to the transaction was
17 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 acting under undue influence or the terms of the
2 transaction were not negotiated at arms-length, the
3 construction costs shall be determined based on average
4 construction costs in the state for the applicable tax
5 year. The department shall adopt rules specifying how
6 significant additions to residential real property and
7 construction costs are reported. As used in this
8 subdivision, "significant addition" means any construction
9 of real property that adds habitable square feet to the
10 residential real property and includes construction where
11 all or a portion of the residential real property is
12 demolished and reconstructed. "Significant addition" shall
13 not include finishing an unfinished portion of the existing
14 residential real property.
15
16 (C) The amount determined pursuant to
17 subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall be the
18 fair market value of the residential real property until
19 ownership of the property is transferred to a new person.
20 Each time residential real property is transferred to a new
21 person, the property shall be valued as provided in
22 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to determine the new
23 base year value of the property. The new base year value of
18 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 the property shall be subject to the inflation factor
2 provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph in
3 subsequent tax years;
4
5 (D) As used in this paragraph:
6
7 (I) "Acquisition value," as used in
8 this subparagraph, means the actual full amount paid or to
9 be paid to acquire residential real property;
10
11 (II) "Residential real property" means
12 real property improved by a dwelling designed to house not
13 more than four (4) families and includes a detached garage
14 owned by the owner of the dwelling and any associated
15 residential land up to thirty-five (35) acres where the
16 dwelling is located if the land is owned by the owner of
17 the dwelling. The dwelling may include any type of
18 residence including a single family home, an individual
19 condominium unit, a mobile home or a trailer if the
20 dwelling is used as a primary residence;
21
22 (III) "Transfer" or "acquisition" of
23 residential real property does not include:
19 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1
2 (1) A transfer of property
3 between spouses or between a parent and their child;
4
5 (2) A transfer of property
6 pursuant to a court order including to effectuate a
7 settlement agreement or in compliance with a decree of
8 divorce or judicial separation;
9
10 (3) A transfer of property to a
11 trust established for the benefit of the prior owner;
12
13 (4) A transfer of property to a
14 corporation, partnership or limited liability company if
15 the prior owner of the property is a shareholder or owner
16 of the corporation, partnership or limited liability
17 company;
18
19 (5) A donation of residential
20 real property to a religious or charitable organization
21 including a nonprofit organization;
22
20 HB0282

2025 STATE OF WYOMING 25LSO-0305
1 (6) Any other transfer of
2 property that the department determines by rule should not
3 be an acquisition of property due to the relationship of
4 the parties or other factors.

11 of his property shall file not later than thirty (30) days
12 after the date of the assessment schedule properly sent
13 pursuant to W.S. 39-13-103(b)(vii), a statement with the
14 county assessor specifying the reasons why the assessment
15 is incorrect. For purposes of this paragraph, if a
16 statement of reasons is mailed or sent by electronic
17 transmission by the person assessed, it shall be deemed
18 timely filed if it is postmarked or transmitted not later
19 than thirty (30) days after the mailing or the electronic
20 transmission of the notification of the assessment
21 schedule. The county assessor shall provide a copy to the
22 county clerk as clerk of the county board of equalization.
23 The county assessor and the person contesting the
21 HB0282

1 assessment, or his agent, shall disclose witnesses and
2 exchange information, evidence and documents relevant to
3 the appeal, including sales information from relevant
4 statements of consideration if requested, no later than
5 thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled county board of
6 equalization hearing. The assessor shall specifically
7 identify the sales information used to determine market
8 value of the property under appeal. A county board of
9 equalization may receive evidence relative to any
10 assessment and may require the person assessed or his agent
11 or attorney to appear before it, be examined and produce
12 any documents relating to the assessment. The appeal may be
13 dismissed if any person willfully neglects or refuses to
14 attend a meeting of a county board of equalization and be
15 examined or answer any material question upon the board's
16 request. The state board of equalization shall adopt rules
17 to be followed by any county board of equalization when
18 conducting appeals under this subsection. All hearings
19 shall be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted by
20 the state board of equalization. Each hearing shall be
21 recorded electronically or by a court reporter or a
22 qualified stenographer or transcriptionist. The taxpayer
23 may present any evidence that is relevant, material or not

4 39-13-103(b)(xviii)(A)(III). The county attorney or his
5 designee may represent the county board or the assessor,
6 but not both. The assessor may be represented by an
7 attorney and the board may hire a hearing officer. All
8 deliberations of the board shall be in public. The county
9 board of equalization may affirm the assessor's valuation
10 or find in favor of the taxpayer and remand the case back
11 to the assessor. The board shall make specific written
12 findings and conclusions as to the evidence presented not
13 later than October 1 of each year;
